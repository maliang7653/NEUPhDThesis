  abstract = {In the present work, a knowledge-based system is developed for the prediction of surface roughness in turning process. Neural networks and fuzzy set theory are used for this purpose. Knowledge acquired from the shop floor is used to train the neural network. The trained network provides a number of data sets, which are fed to a fuzzy-set-based rule generation module. A large number of 1 F-THEN rules are generated, which can be reduced to a smaller set of rules by using Boolean operations. The developed rule base may be used for predicting surface roughness for given process variables as well as for the prediction of process variables for a given surface roughness. The concise set of rules helps the user in understanding the behavior of the cutting process and to assess the effectiveness of the model. The performance of the developed knowledge-based system is studied with the experimental data of dry and wet turning of mild steel with HSS and carbide tools. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {An experimental study conducted on the rheological properties of a magnetorheological fluid based on submicrometric silica-coated magnetite particles dispersed in silicone oil is presented. We investigated the rheological behaviour when the system is simultaneously exposed to a static field and a sinusoidal field used as a perturbation. The results show that the perturbation modifies the rheological behaviour of the system and can be used to control its physical properties; however, the changes that are induced are smaller than expected from previous results for the aggregation of particles under magnetic perturbations. We discussed this difference in terms of the ratio between the magnetic energy and the thermal energy. We observed that a threshold magnetic field exists; below it, the yield stress is practically zero, whereas above it, the yield stress grows quickly. We discuss this result in terms of a model based on chain length distribution.},

  abstract = {In determining the vibrations and deflections occurring during end milling process, the modeling and structural behavior plays an important role. The geometry of an end mill tool is complex. To overcome the complexity of the analysis, a simple beam model is considered. In this work the modeling of structure of an end mill is carried out and by the application of Finite Element Methods. The Static analysis has been performed in order to determine the deflection and suppress the vibration of end mill cutter so that the work piece will not have waviness on the surface, leading to minimization of chatter encountered during machining. The effect of dynamic response of the end mill tool is studied with and without the application of MR damper. Metal cutting operation involves interaction of cutting forces of the tool with the regenerative forces of the material of work piece during metal cutting. To control the end mill tool vibration and suppress the chatter, the method incorporates the unique features of a magnetic-rheological fluid, utilizes the damper input current to modify the magnetic field inside the coil of the damper and increase the variable stiffness and produce damping effect. In this work, the identification of chatter is done by means of the Bingham number of the magnetic-rheological fluid. The different metal cutting parameters are considered in experimental work and results are compared with and without the application of magnetic-rheological damping effect. The results show the enhancement of quality of the machined surface, reduction of deflection of the end mill tool and decrease in the chatter marks on work piece by producing magnetic-rheological damping to the end mill tool. The experimental tests were conducted with and without the application of the magnetic-rheological damper during machining, end mill tool deflection was determined. The damper input current is varied from 0 to 2 Amps, which modifies the rheological damping effect to the end mill at different machining parameters and the results are validated with finite element analysis software ANSYS 11.0. It is inferred that experimental results are in good agreement with results in ANSYS. It is seen that ANSYS can predict the value of deflection very accurately with a variation of 3% to 5% of the actual value, indicating the validity that ANSYS for the analysis of both H.S.Steel and carbide cutter in case of two and four flute end milling under different machining conditions. The effectiveness of the MR damper is used in an end milling operation and it is successfully established in the project.},

  abstract = {The grind-hardening process uses the heat generated within the grinding zone in order to produce surface hardening of the workpiece. However, after the process, workpieces present dimensional inaccuracies and poor surface roughness. Thus, a final grinding operation has to be performed. For an industrial implementation of the whole process, two problems need to be solved. On the one hand, on-line control of the hardness penetration depth (HPD) should be achieved. On the other hand, excessive softening of the workpiece has to be avoided during the finishing grinding. This paper, firstly, investigates the feasibility of using the area based grinding energy ( E c ″ ) for the prediction of the HPD. Surface grind-hardening tests carried out on 100Cr6, 42CrMo4 and AISI 1045 steels have shown that, for all the tested parameter sets, a linear correlation exists between E c ″ and HPD. Furthermore, the slope of this linear relationship can be estimated from the chemical composition of the hardened steel based on the equivalent carbon number. On the other hand, the influence of varying wheel dressing conditions on the E c ″ –HPD relationship is analysed. Secondly, it has been found that a relationship exists between E c ″ and the surface softening during the finishing grinding operation. This relationship is independent of the grinding parameter combination when the maximum undeformed chip thickness is over a threshold value. Thus, E c ″ is a very appropriate parameter to control both the hardening and the finishing process of grind-hardened workpieces.},

In this sense, we have focused to design a rotary motor using solar power with similar working principle as a Curie wheel. This paper describes the modeling, simulation and design of a Curie thermomagnetic motor. Three materials were analyzed for the rotor, out of which two of them present a second order phase transition a 30% FeNi alloy and Gd, and the MnAs that presents a first order transition. In addition, the heat transfer inherent to the conversion process of solar energy and natural convection were studied utilizing a one-dimensional finite difference model, and the best performance for the assumed initial conditions for the motor for all materials was with a convention coefficient of 10 W/(m2 K). A model for the magnetic circuit was also developed. It could be verified that Gd and MnAs offers about one order of magnitude more power when compared to 30% NiFe alloy. An experimental bench engine prototype was also designed, but not built, utilizing the same parameter values and considerations applied to the simulation, in order to fit it with the mathematical model. Moreover, a cylindrical concave mirror and mechanism was designed to harness the needed solar energy, which can be adjusted to keep incident solar rays always perpendicular to the mirror.},

  abstract = {Swollen physical magnetorheological (MR) gels were obtained by self-assembly of triblock copolymers containing dispersed magnetic particles. We carry out a detailed investigation of the nonlinear rheological properties of MR gels under large amplitude oscillatory shear flow. A strong Payne effect is observed for strains above 0.05% which is the limit of linear viscoelastic region. The onset strain for the transition from linear to nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour is much smaller than in the absence of a magnetic field. We show that the magnetic Payne effect strongly depends on the magnetic flux density, the particle volume fraction, the sample's initial particle distribution and viscoelastic properties of the matrix. The rheological response of MR gels is strongly related to the ability for rearrangement of the particles in the presence of the magnetic field. Upon sudden application of a magnetic field, the particle network embedded in a soft matrix becomes more anisotropic than is the case in a hard matrix since the resistance of the matrix to particle rearrangement is smaller. The induced anisotropic particle network parallel to the field provides larger absolute rheological response.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this work was to experimentally validate numerical thermal models of the dry grinding manufacturing processes. Two models were developed: one for low depths of cut that ignored the effects of the contact angle, referred to as the shallow grinding model, and one for large depths of cut that included the effects of the contact angle, referred to as the deep grinding model. Both of the models were developed using the commercial finite element package ANSYS and were then compared to in-process temperatures acquired with a full-field infrared video camera. The comparison showed that the numerical models were capable of accurately predicting the shape and intensity of the temperature contours of the infrared images as well as temperature profiles extracted form the images within a margin of error of approximately 9–17%. The results also showed that the shallow grinding model was more precise at small depths of cut while the deep grinding model was more precise at larger depths of cut and that there was a clear transition region where both models performed equally well. The thermal partition ratios used in the numerical models were initially calculated using existing analytical models and refined using a temperature matching technique between the temperature measurements and the numerical models. It was found that during shallow grinding the analytical models were able to predict the actual thermal partition ratios within an average error of 5.7%, while during deep grinding the average error increased to approximately 13.4%.},

  abstract = {Objectives/Methods From a materials scientist's perspective, dental materials used for tooth repair should exhibit compatible mechanical properties. Fulfillment of this criterion is complicated by the fact that teeth have a hierarchical structure with changing mechanical behavior at different length scales. In this study, nanoindentation with an 8 μm spherical indenter was used to determine the elastic/plastic transition under contact loading for enamel. Results The indentation elastic/plastic transition of enamel at the length scale of several hundreds of hydroxyapatite crystallites, which are within one enamel rod, is revealed for the first time. The corresponding penetration depth at the determined indentation yield point of 1.6 GPa and 0.6% strain is only 7 nm. As a consequence of the small depth it is decisive for the experiment to calibrate the indenter tip radius in this loading regime. The elastic modulus of 123 GPa was evaluated directly by the Hertzian penetration and not by the unloading part of the indentation curve. Significance We believe these data are also a valuable contribution to understand the mechanical behavior of enamel and to develop nanoscale biomimetic materials.},

A series of acids with the same carboxyl group but different carbon chain lengths (C12, C14, C16 and C18) were added to magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) to investigate their effect on the stability and rheological behavior. MR effect was measured with the aid of a magnetorheometer and stability measurements were made by simple determining the height of the transparent layer in the MRF over a 6-month period. Experimental results showed that by increasing carbon chain length of acids, yield stress and stability increased up to 22 times (at H = 362 kA/m) and 7 times, respectively, in comparison to the additive-free MRF. Model fitting confirmed that all of the acid-based MRFs showed a yield stress with shear thinning behavior and followed Herschel–Bulkley model. Further investigations suggested that 3 wt% stearic acid was the most promising additive in increasing MR effect and stability. The results of stability and rheological tests showed that further increase in stearic acid fraction improved stability slightly and, at the same time, increased the off-state viscosity to a huge extent undesirably.},

In this modern set of suspensions which can be called smart or functional fluids, fluid flow, particles movement and heat transfer process can be controlled by applying magnetic fields. Regarding unique characteristics of MNFs, studies in this field have witnessed a phenomenal growth. This paper reviews and summarizes recent investigations implemented on MNFs including those conducted on thermophysical properties, natural convection, forced convection, boiling as well as their practical applications.

Research and development activities related to ER fluids and their applications have increased dramatically during the last few decades. If commercialised, ER fluids could have a significant impact on hydraulic equipment, and be utilised in the automotive, marine, aerospace, robotics, and machinery industries. The objective of the present study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using ER fluids to produce 'smart' lubricants that can control friction and wear of sliding components. The ER lubricant effect is demonstrated using a unique test machine that utilises hydrostatic lubrication. It is found that the friction torque increases by as much as 30% when a voltage of 2000 V is applied to an ER fluid in the newly developed test machine.},

A custom high shear rate ( γ ̇ &gt;10,000 s−1) Searle cell magnetorheometer, along with a full scale rotary-vane magnetorheological energy absorber ( γ ̇ &gt;25,000 s−1) are employed to analyze MRF property scaling across shear rates using a nondimensional Mason number to generate an MRF master curve. Incorporating a Reynolds temperature correction factor, data from both experiments is shown to collapse to a single master curve, supporting the use of Mason number to correlate low- and high-shear rate characterization data.},

A non-linear dependence of Hall voltage on the induction of the applied magnetic field and a hysteresis loop of this voltage in the shape of inclined digit eight were found. The causes of the observed effects is the ordering of silicon steel particles and graphite particles along the side of magnetic field lines.},

Formations and dimensions of the produced scratches were investigated to explain the grain action on the surface and the glass material removal rate. It has been found that humid environment created by the use of the slurry of loose abrasives causes more significant damages than the dry one. The use of slurry produces higher glass material removal rate in this environment and proves its utility in the lapping process. The shape of abrasive grains influences the nature of their action. Indeed, the worn grains produce scratches and chippings less than the sharp grains. During lapping, the number of scratches and theirs dimensions depend on the contact time and the abrasive grain size. It was concluded that the glass material removal rate during lapping depends on the cumulative actions of individual grains which produce scratches and chippings.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a closed hydraulic circuit damper, having a magnetorheological suspension as a fluid medium, and an external field coil. The magnetorheological suspension is made of iron micro-particles in silicon oil. The volume ratio of the particles (mean diameter of 2.15 μm and standard deviation of 0.40 μm) is 25%. In the absence of the applied magnetic field, an uniform motion of the piston with velocity v ranging from 6.6×10−5 to 23.33×10−5 m s−1, is produced by a mean force F0=8.5 N. The driving force F increases linearly with v, beginning with H=7.96 kA m−1. For H=47.60 kA m−1 and v=23.33×10−5 m s−1, a ratio F/F0=24 was obtained.},

Measurements of residual stresses in the surface layer reveal compressive stresses in the hardened zone and tensile stresses in the non-hardened zone. These experimental observations are compared with the results of representative simulations of the cutting process. A large-deformation thermo-elasto-viscoplastic material model is used and the geometry of the cutting tool is precisely reflected by the finite element discretisation. To predict the overall response, an adaptive remeshing scheme and full thermo-mechanical coupling is accounted for. Moreover, measured residual stresses are incorporated as initial conditions within the simulation.},

The tribological properties of OM, OS, OX, HS, HSI and HQ grades of carbonyl iron based MR fluids were tested using a ball-on-three plates tribometer to ascertain the optimal lubricant. Wear scars on the PTFE sheets were examined by optical microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for imaging and elemental analysis of the worn surface. The research shows that OS based lubricating MR fluids have the optimal anti-wear and friction reducing properties probably due to the amorphous silica surface coating of the particles. Mechanisms by which MR fluids improve tribological behavior concern particle entrapment and (soft) surface indentation.},

The extensions of the model necessary for the description of the formation of the periodic structures in the rotating field are considered and the relevance of the present model for the explanation of phase separation in shear flows of magnetorheological suspensions is indicated.},

The characteristics of the structure depend on the amplitude of the imposed strain; at low strain the sheets are perpendicular to the velocity lines, whereas they become perpendicular to the vorticity axis at high strain. The electrostatic forces between the particles, which are induced by the electric field, give an elastic modulus to the suspension. With an appropriated experimental device, we have measured for a given structure the elastic component of the shear modulus with a strain either parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the sheets. The storage modulus for a strain in the plane of the sheets is found to be several times larger than for a strain in the perpendicular direction. A possible explanation of this strong anisotropy in elastic shear modulus is given in terms of the microscopic structure inside the sheets.},

In addition to the well known hydrolysis reactions Si – O – Si + H 2 O → Si – OH + Si – OH and Si – O – Al + H 2 O → Si – OH + Al – OH , a peculiar mechanism is found, leading to the formation of an AlO3–H2O entity and the breaking of Al–O–Si bond. In the glass bulk, most of the hydrolysis reactions are endothermic. Only a few regular sites are found reactive (i.e. in association with an exothermic reaction), and in that case, the hydrolysis reaction leads to a decrease of the local disorder in the amorphous vitreous network. Afterwards, we suggest that ionic charge compensators transform into network modifiers when hydrolysis occurs, according to a global process firstly suggested by Burnham in 1975. Our theoretical computations provide a more general model of the first hydrolysis steps that could help to understand experimental data and water speciation in glasses.},

Using the Monte Carlo technique, the effects of interactions on the determination of magnetic particle size distribution parameters are investigated. It is shown that these interactions introduce a significant error in the value obtained for the standard deviation, whilst the effect on the median diameter is less pronounced. Using an approach based on the representation of interactions by means of a thermodynamic ordering temperature, expressions are derived which enable the distribution parameters of a weakly interacting system of particles to be determined. These equations are applied to experimental data for two different types of colloidal dispersion, in each case giving improved results.},

Considering the chemical performance of the used coolants, it is necessary to gain additional information about the chemical mechanisms in the contact zone in order to evaluate the surface quality. This paper deals with investigations of the influence of machining processes on the generation of reaction layers. These layers were generated by using certain coolant additives in machining. For industrial applications it is very interesting to know which effects different coolant additives have on the workpiece surface, because it is well known that adsorption and reaction layers of machining processes hinder thermochemical heat treatment.},

Theoretically, the execution time for such a calculation should grow only linearly with the number of spins, and this is confirmed here for up to order 10<sup>5</sup> spins. In addition, the implementation efficiently uses a large number of processors. For a test case of 64 000 dipoles, the measured speedup is over 25 for 40 processors on a four-processor-per-node IBM SP; this compares quite favorably with less-flexible FMM implementations. The generic implementation allows for easy changes of the basis functions used to expand potentials specific to particular applications, facilitating direct comparison of different approaches. Here, the traditional spherical-harmonic expansions are compared to Cartesian expansions which reflect the cubic symmetries of meshes used in typical micromagnetic simulations.},

In the first part of the paper the relationship between the most relevant process parameters and residual stresses was established. This second part is aimed to the assessment of the influence of the machined material. Carbon and alloyed steels were machined varying feed rate and nose radius, and results show that the effect of process parameters can be considered to be additive to the influence of the material. This means that for the investigated steels the increase in residual stresses due to a variation in process parameters remains almost the same, while material characteristics only influence the mean level of residual stresses. Based on this observation, a first empirical predictive model was identified, which is valid only for carbon steels. It was found that for this kind of steels the equivalent carbon content fully characterises the material. A second predictive model was then derived for both alloyed and carbon steels, and it was found that the Rockwell hardness can be directly related to the mean level of residual stresses. The models were then used to build two nomograms that can be useful in the selection of the optimal turning parameters of a generic steel, different from the ones investigated in this work.},

  abstract = {It is well known that tensile residual stresses can be highly detrimental for several functional aspects, such as fatigue life, corrosion and wear resistance, etc., whereas compressive residual stresses are usually considered to have a positive influence on these aspects. The residual stresses that can be found in a mechanical component are mainly generated in the final steps of the machining process. The level of the generated residual stresses depends on the machined material and on the process parameters used. Therefore, the enhancement of the reliability and longevity of a part imposes that a lot of attention is paid to the residual stress problem in the process parameter selection. Unfortunately the mechanism of residual stresses generation is still not completely clear, and a relationship between process parameters and residual stresses is missing. Consequently, the parameter selection is still performed without considering the residual stress problem. The overall goal of the present paper (in two parts) is to identify an analytical relationship between residual stresses and turning process parameters, accounting also for the material being machined. This relationship is the basis for the optimal parameter selection to enhance the longevity and reliability of a part. Following an empirical approach, in the first part of the paper the process parameters that influence residual stresses are identified for three different steels with large differences in mechanical properties. The effect of feed rate, nose radius, entrance angle and depth of cut is investigated using the DOE and ANOVA techniques applied to X-ray diffraction measurements of residual stresses. Results show that the depth of cut does not influence the level of residual stresses, while the main role is played by feed rate and nose radius, and a mild influence is exerted by entrance angle. These results are consistent with the three steels investigated, suggesting that the mechanism of residual stress generation is influenced by process parameters in a common way. An analytical predictive model was then identified for the three steels, including the most relevant process parameters. In the second part of the paper, the influence of the machined material is empirically assessed.},

For this purpose, a specific sandbox was designed to include the possibility of quickly applying and removing a magnetic field below a MR fluid layer, in order to induce an instantaneous change from a frictional to a viscous behavior in the basal décollement material. The simulation of gravitational gliding and sediment progradation above a basal mobile shale layer provided results that compare well with analogue models produced with other experimental techniques, and with natural structures like those developed in the Niger delta region. This pilot study thus encourages further research for optimizing the applicability of MR fluids to the analogue simulation of geological processes.},

In the development of predictive models, machining parameters of traverse speed, waterjet pressure, standoff distance, abrasive grit size and abrasive flow rate were considered as model variables. For this purpose, Taguchi's design of experiments was carried out in order to collect surface roughness values. A feed forward neural network based on back propagation was made up of 13 input neurons, 22 hidden neurons and one output neuron. The 13 sets of data were randomly selected from orthogonal array for training and residuals were used to check the performance. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and F-test were used to check the validity of regression model and to determine the significant parameter affecting the surface roughness. The statistical analysis showed that the waterjet pressure was an utmost parameter on surface roughness. The microstructures, of machined surfaces were also studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM investigations revealed that AWJ machining produced three distinct zones along the cut surface of AA 7075 aluminium alloy and surface striations and waviness were increased significantly with jet pressure.

  abstract = {Incorporating the random nature of grit distribution, this paper presents a closed form expression for the stochastic grinding force as a function of the grinding conditions and grit distribution. The stochastic grit density function is introduced to describe the random grit distribution of the rotating wheel. The dynamic grinding force is formulated as the convolution of a single-grit force and the grit density function. The single-grit force is obtained from analysis of the grinding geometry and treated as a deterministic impulse response of the grinding process. The spectrum characteristics of the grinding force are investigated in the frequency domain, where the power spectrum density (PSD) of the total grinding force can be expressed as a product of the energy spectrum density of the single-grit force and the PSD of the grit density function. The analytical nature of the PSD expression of the grinding force allows the identification of the PSD of the grit density function and the mechanistic grinding coefficients, and facilitates the analysis of the effects of the grit distribution and grinding conditions upon the grinding force. A series of grinding experiments were performed and their results discussed to validate this model. The results show that predictions drawn from the theoretical model are substantiated by the PSD, variance, and time domain signal of the experimentally measured grinding forces under various grinding conditions.},

The model accounts for the contributions from the constitutive characteristics and thermal properties of the materials and the key polishing parameters. It was found that the material removal was dominated by six dimensionless variable groups involving chemical reaction, diffusion and mechanical wear. A comparison with the experimental measurement showed that the model predicts quantitatively and can be used conveniently for process planning and equipment design. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Through a systematic experimental investigation into the polishing of polycrystalline diamond composites by the dynamic friction technique, this paper identified three major regimes of polishing conditions: the regime capable of a low material removal, that enabling a safe, high removal processing, and that of an unsafe but ultra-high material removal. The study concluded that a higher polishing pressure-speed combination results in a high material removal rate, but with a greater risk of workpiece cracking. At a too low-pressure-speed combination, on the other hand, material removal may not take place. Based on the systematic experimental measurements, the paper established a polishing map to characterise the polishing conditions. It was found that using the polishing parameters determined by this polishing map, a quality surface finish can be obtained efficiently in duration about 10 times shorter than that of the abrasive polishing process currently used in industry.

Additionally, the density and the sp(2) to sp(3) ratio in the hybridized carbon materials of the debris were estimated from the EELS spectra. It was found that the debris were mainly of amorphous structure and consisted of different forms of carbon, silicon oxide/carbide, iron oxides, etc. The results show that during polishing, the diamond has transformed to nondiamond carbon, and silicon carbide to amorphous silicon carbide/oxide.

The heat generated is taken as the product of the friction force and the relative sliding velocity between the PCD asperities and the metal disk surface. The Jaeger's moving heat source analysis is then applied to determine the fractions of heat flux flowing into the PCD asperities and their counterpart in contact sliding and to give rise to the average temperature rise.

However, the fundamental mechanisms of the process for polishing reaction-bonded silicon carbide (RB-SiC) have not yet been studied in detail. This paper is concerned with the fabrication processability aspect of the RB-SiC components, and investigates results obtained by magnetorheological finishing (MRF) of RB-SiC mirror. It details experimentally the features of different polishing fluids and the characteristics of relative removal rates, analyses the processing limitations of the normal processing techniques and studies the effects of certain processing parameters on surface accuracy. The final surface roughness with an initial value of Ra = 17.58 nm reached 4.03 nm after 15 h of polishing, and then convergent to 1.03 nm after another 7 h fine polishing. Experimental results based on the magnetorheological (MR) fluids show that, a MR fluid containing diamond particles helps to accelerate removal rates. Additionally, by adding a small amount of CeO2 into the diamond-based MR fluid, it is possible to finish RB-SiC material to a higher level of surface quality.},

MR fluid is a functional mixture of non-colloidal magnetic particle of micrometer size suspended in a host fluid, with the special property that its viscosity can be varied by the application of a magnetic field. This paper introduces the basic principles of the methodology and presents experiment results on MR fluids using a 2-axis wheel-shaped tool supporting dual magnetic fields. Mathematical models taking into account the pressure and the tool velocity are derived. The experiments serve to evaluate the effects of process parameters on material removal and performance using a K9 glass parabolic lens of 60 mm diameter as work-piece. It is shown that surface roughness can be reduced from an initial value of 3.8-1.2 nm after 10 min of polishing. The form errors can also be improved from an initial 2.27 mu m rms and 7.89 mu m peak-to-valley to become 0.36 mu m rms and 2.01 mu m peak-to-valley after 60 min of polishing.

In recent years, these systems have been synthesized by several teams in order to enhance technological properties of traditional magnetic fluids. We suppose that the micron-sized particles, under the action of an applied magnetic field, form linear chain-like aggregates. Analysis shows that the presence of the ferrofluid can significantly increase the magnetoviscous effect in the suspension of the particles. Unlike the traditional models of magnetorheological suspensions (MRSs) with chains, we have studied the effect of mutual magnetization of particles in chains. Estimates show that this effect significantly increases macroscopical viscous stress in the suspensions and that is why it must be taken into account for theoretical descriptions and interpretation of experiments on the rheological properties of magnetic suspensions.},

Lapping of borofloat, BK7 and quartz substrates were performed at optimized conditions. The removal rate was found to be highest in the case of borofloat, followed by quartz and BK7. The removal rate trend could not be explained based on the hardness of the material because quartz shows higher removal rate in spite of its higher hardness when compared to the BK7 substrate. The glass substrate forms a hydrated layer when it is exposed to an aqueous environment, and that depends on the composition of the substrate. The hardness of the material decreases significantly in the aqueous environment due to the formation of a hydration layer. The formation of a hydration layer is thought to facilitate faster and easier penetration of diamond abrasive into the substrate. Penetration then results in brittle fracture and the formation of lumps of debris.},

One is a rotational coaxial cylinder viscometer, and the other is a rotational parallel disk viscometer.

Shear stress is predominantly determined by material mechanical properties. A modified Prestons equation is proposed to estimate the material removal in MRF by combining shear stress and material mechanical properties. We investigate extensively the effect of various MRF process parameters, including abrasive concentration, magnetic field strength, penetration depth and wheel speed, on material removal efficiency. Material removal rate model is expanded to include these parameters. We develop a nonaqueous magnetorheological MR) fluid for examining the mechanical contribution in MRF material removal.

Data are collected on a magnetorheological finishing (MRF) spot taking machine (STM) with a standard aqueous magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Normal and shear forces are measured simultaneously, in situ, with a dynamic dual load cell. Shear stress is found to be independent of nanodiamond concentration, penetration depth, magnetic field strength, and the relative velocity between the part and the rotating MR fluid ribbon. Shear stress, determined primarily by the material mechanical properties, dominates removal in MRF. The addition of nanodiamond abrasives greatly enhances the material removal efficiency, with the removal rate saturating at a high abrasive concentration. The volumetric removal rate (VRR) increases with penetration depth but is insensitive to magnetic field strength. The VRR is strongly correlated with the relative velocity between the ribbon and the part, as expected by the Preston equation. A modified removal rate model for MRF offers a better estimation of MRF removal capability by including nanodiamond concentration and penetration depth.},

We have studied the effect of structuring the particles in chains on the quasistatic behavior in elongation in the absence of magnetic field. The effect of a coupling molecule between the surface of the particles and the elastomer is also analyzed. It is shown that the modulus of the first loading curve is strongly increased by structuring the particles, and also by the use of a coupling agent. Using an effective medium approach we well reproduce the experimental behavior of the elastic modulus and we deduce that a thick layer of elastomer is still present between the particles. A finite element calculation allows to distinguish between two modes of rupture at high strains, depending on the strength of the coupling between the particles and the matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for identifying clusters in magnetic dispersion simulations is presented. The technique is based on maximisation of the entropy of the system. Clusters are generated which are maximally non-committal with respect to missing data resulting in assignments which closely reflect the nature of the association between the objects. By way of illustration, the method is applied to two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulations of a ferrofluid where the particles are assumed to interact via a point dipole potential. The clusters determined by the algorithm would appear to be perfectly acceptable for this type of interaction. The method is also successfully applied to the more complex case of 3D structures in a strongly interacting particulate dispersion.},

The fast multipole method (FMM) is one of the most efficient methods used to perform matrix鈥搗ector products and accelerate the resolution of the linear system. A problem involving N degrees of freedom may be solved in CNiterNlogN floating operations, where C is a constant depending on the implementation of the method. In this article several techniques allowing one to reduce the constant C are analyzed. This reduction implies a lower total CPU time and a larger range of application of the FMM. In particular, new interpolation and anterpolation schemes are proposed which greatly improve on previous algorithms. Several numerical tests are also described. These confirm the efficiency and the theoretical complexity of the FMM.},

By intelligently controlling these two motions uniform smooth mirror-like finished surface in the range of nm has been achieved. For parametric analysis of the process, the experiments have been planned using design of experiments technique and response surface regression analysis is performed to analyze the effects of process parameters on finishing performance. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is conducted and contribution of each model term affecting percent improvement in surface finish is calculated. The experimental results are discussed and optimum finishing conditions are identified from optimization study. The present study shows that rotational speed of the magnet has most significant effect on output response (percentage improvement in surface roughness, %Ra). The best surface finish obtained on stainless steel workpiece with R-MRAFF process is 16 nm.},

This paper deals with the theoretical investigations into the mechanism of MRAFF process to study the effects of various process parameters. In the present work, an attempt has been made to analyze the medium flow through the fixture by finite difference method by assuming the medium as Bingham plastic to evaluate the stresses developed during the process. A capillary viscometer has been designed and fabricated to study the effect of magnetic field on the rheological properties of the medium. Microstructure of the mixture of ferromagnetic and abrasive particles in magnetorheological polishing fluid (MRPF) has been proposed, and normal force on the abrasive particles is calculated from the applied magnetic field. A model for the prediction of material removal and surface roughness has also been presented. Theoretical results compare well with the experimental data available in the literature.},

During curing of the elastomer, an applied magnetic field aligns the particles into chains. The shear modulus of the resulting cured material is sensitive to magnetic fields of several kOe magnitude. Such sensitivity to magnetic field makes these materials attractive for applications in automotive mounting components. At large fields (magnetic induction B1 T), the Fe particles are completely magnetized or saturated. Calculations using finite element analysis show that for typical elastomers the increase in shear modulus due to interparticle magnetic forces at saturation is about 50% of the zero-field modulus. The optimum particle volume fraction for the largest fractional change in modulus at saturation is predicted to be 27%. Calculations of the zero-field shear modulus perpendicular to the chain axis indicate that it does not exceed the modulus of a filled elastomer with randomly dispersed particles of the same concentration.},

In this work, PAP was applied to the smoothing of reaction sintered silicon carbide (RS-SiC) surface. Experimental results indicated that a higher oxidation rate led to a smoother surface. The smoothing mechanism was discussed based on the relationship between oxidation rate of RS-SiC and polishing rate of oxide layer. Through increase in the oxidation rate and decrease in the polishing rate, a smooth surface with 11.42 nm p–v and 0.91 nm rms was obtained. The amount and depth of scratches also decreased after PAP using ceria abrasives compared with the surface polished by diamond abrasives.},

Macro-scale models consider the overall wheel–workpiece interaction while micro-scale models focus on the individual grain–workpiece interactions. Each model is discussed and the relevant boundary conditions, material constitutive treatments, and load inputs are compared. Future directions for finite element grinding modeling are then recommended and, based on the results of this review, synthesized current state-of-the-art macro- and micro-scale modeling approaches are presented.},

In order to characterize the conformation of the aggregates, we study the evolution of various fractal dimensions during aggregation and disaggregation processes (i.e., when the applied field is switched on and off), using video-microscopy and image analysis. Experiments have been performed by varying the values of two external parameters: the magnetic field amplitude and particle concentration. We found that the box-counting dimension, related with how the aggregates occupy the surrounding space, depends on the ratio R 1 / R 0 . During the first stage of the disaggregation process, when the particles are moving by Brownian motion inside the aggregate, Family–Vicsek scaling function is verified.},

Soft magnetic properties and densities of the amorphous particles and the CI particles were tested and compared. The results indicate the amorphous particles present a lower density but larger magnetization intensity and larger permeability at lower field levels. Properties of the AMRF with 20% particles in volume fraction were tested and compared with the CI based MR fluid (CMRF). The AMRF presents a saturation yield stress of 41 kPa at ∼227 kA/m and a sedimentation ratio of 80%.

A general three-dimensional non-linear constitutive law for such a fluid is given for the case in which the magnetic induction vector is used as the independent magnetic variable. The equations are needed for the analysis of boundary-value problems involving fluids with dispersed micron-sized ferrous particles subjected to a time-independent magnetic field. For illustration, the equations are applied, in the case of an incompressible fluid, to the solution of some basic problems. We consider unidirectional flow in a region confined by two infinite parallel plates with a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plates. Next, we examine two problems involving a circular cylindrical geometry with the fluid occupying the region between two concentric cylinders: axial flow subjected to an axial magnetic field and circumferential flow with a circumferential field. After making some simplifying assumptions on the constitutive law and choosing material parameters, numerical solutions for the velocity profiles are illustrated.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a more comprehensive experimental model which has the capability of predicting residual stress profile. The main advantage of this model over the existing models that it provides the effect of machining parameters on maximum residual stress and determines both the location and depth of this maximum residual stress. Five different materials namely; stainless steel-304, steel-37, 7001 and 2024-aluminum alloys and brass were machined by turning utilizing one of experimental design techniques based on response surface methodology. Tensile strength of these materials and both cutting speed and feed rates are considered as three input parameters affecting residual stress distribution. The residual stress distribution in the machined surface region was determined using a deflection-etching technique. It is proposed here that the residual stress profile is a deterministic function of the three input parameters used. Also, it is postulated that the residual stress profile along the depth beneath surface is a polynomial function of the depth beneath surface and the coefficients of this polynomial are, in turn, functions of the input parameters. The model has been developed and has been checked for accuracy.},

The method is based on the virial expansion in terms of density as well as the dipolar coupling constant 位 , and it uses diagram technique. The formulas and the diagrams, needed to calculate the second B 2 and third B 3 virial coefficients, are derived up to the order of 鈭� 位 3 , and compared to the zero-field case. The formula for B 2 is the same as in the zero-field case; the formula for B 3 , however, is different in an applied field, and a derivation is presented. This is a surprising result which is not emphasized in standard texts, but which has been noticed before in the virial expansion for flexible molecules (Caracciolo et聽al., 2006; Caracciolo et聽al., 2008). To verify the correctness of the obtained formulas, B 2 and B 3 were calculated within the accuracy of 位 2 , which were applied to initial magnetic susceptibility. The obtained expression fully coincides with the well-known theories (Morozov and Lebedev, 1990; Huke and L眉cke, 2000; Ivanov and Kuznetsova, 2001), which used different methods to calculate the initial magnetic susceptibility.},

A new model is developed that is capable of predicting both order-tisorder and condensation phase transitions. For systems with weak interactions, the results of this model are compared with both lattice Monte Carlo simulation data and simple isotherm theories that are commonly used to fit experimental data. The results show that these simple isotherms are incapable of duplicating complex behaviour exhibited by anisotropic molecules. When sufficiently strong interactions are present, confined fluids with directional interactions may spontaneously form ordered structures. It is shown that the ordering predicted by this model can result in the assembly of long chains. Such ordering has been observed experimentally in magnetorheological fluids in a magnetic field. It is shown that the orientation of the chains predicted by this model can be controlled by adjusting the molecule-surface interaction. It may be possible to create nanoscale devices that exploit this type of molecular switching.},

To resolve this undesirable sedimentation, we introduced fibrous single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) into CI suspension as additives. The dynamic yield stress change measured as a function of magnetic field strength was examined by adopting a universal equation which was originally applied for electrorheological (ER) fluids. In addition, the viscoelastic performances of CI/SWNT suspension were compared to investigate the influence of additives on the pristine CI suspension. The sedimentation ratio was also examined to confirm the role of submicron SWNT bundles.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is to investigate the magnetorheological (MR) effect at high flow velocities. A slit-flow rheometer has been built which allows for high speed testing of MR fluid under varying field strengths. The gap size of the rheometer was chosen to achieve high fluid velocity and high shear rates. With a 1?mm gap size, fluid velocities range from?1 to 37?m?s ?1 with resulting shear rates ranging from 0.07 ? 10 5 to 2.5 ? 10 5?s ?1 . In order to evaluate the performance of the fluid, the force required to drive the fluid through the flow channel is measured and force?velocity characteristics are generated. From the force?velocity curves, the apparent viscosity is found. The apparent viscosity is used to calculate the yield stress for several magnetic field strengths. Two MR valve lengths are considered (25.4 and 6.35?mm). At each velocity the yield stress is found using the closed form solution for the non-dimensional yield stress. Fluid dwell time is introduced as the amount of time the fluid spends in the presence of a magnetic field. For the range of velocities considered, fluid dwell times range from 12.4 to 0.18?ms. A reduction in apparent yield stress is observed as dwell time decreases. Results indicate that the MR fluid can achieve 63.2% of the expected yield stress for dwell times greater than 0.6?ms.},

The magnetic material plates work as motor's heat exchangers, and are shaped in form of parallelepipedal plates with internal channels. As the power to be obtained from the motor is a direct function of its operating frequency or velocity, it is important to have an optimized design of the heat exchanger channels.

  abstract = {The high amount of energy input during machining processes with geometrically undefined cutting edges, such as grinding, requires the knowledge of the transient temperature field within the machined surface to avoid thermal damages of the workpiece due to thermal-induced residual tensile stresses or softening for instance. An approach to use the heat generated during grinding is the grind-hardening process, which allows for the process-integrated martensitic surface layer hardening of the workpiece. Because of the used simplifications, for example two-dimensionality, existing approaches to calculate the temperature fields during wet grinding cannot be successfully utilized to predict the phase transformations and the resulting hardened surface layer due to grind-hardening. This paper presents an analytical model, which enables to calculate a three-dimensional temperature field due to grinding and grind-hardening using a triangular heat source and considering the effect of the grinding fluid. Based on the transient temperature distribution, the phase transformation within the surface layer and the resulting hardened layer thickness are determined also using analytical models. The analytical method is validated and analyzed comparing the results with measured ones and with those calculated using the finite element analysis. Thereby, the presented approach allows for the efficient prediction of the thermo-metallurgical effects within the surface layer during grinding and grind-hardening.},

  abstract = {Grind hardening is a stock removal grinding operation in which the heat generated in the grinding zone is used to heat-treat the workpiece surface to a specified depth. A thermal model to describe this process has been developed from the original Jaeger modelling and has been used to predict subsurface time-temperature profiles in the dry cylindrical grinding of 42CrMo4 crankshaft steel using cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels. By comparing with experimental hardness depths, partition ratios were calculated and a polynomial fit applied to the proportion of specific energy entering the workpiece as heat, as a function of specific removal rate. By using this polynomial to provide the heat input to the thermal model, a theoretical chart of workpiece surface speed against depth of cut has been produced, which shows the regions in which grind hardening can be achieved to specified depths. The chart shows lower limits where the martensitic transformation temperature has been reached at certain specified depths and an upper limit where melting starts at the contact surface between the CBN grinding wheel and the workpiece. This chart has then been compared with experimental results for the specific case of a hardened depth of 0.5 mm or greater, with good agreement. The predictions indicate that there is an upper limit on workpiece speed if grind hardening is to be achieved, and that the limiting speed reduces as the required hardness depth increases. The predictions also indicate that there is an optimum work speed of around 10 mm/s for hardness depths below 1.5 mm and an upper limit below 4 mm/s for hardness depths around 2 mm.},

The obtained results showed that (1) when the magnetic field is applied only by installing the upper magnet, a better work surface is obtained but the material removal becomes smaller compared with that both the upper and lower magnets are installed; (2) a better surface and a larger material removal are obtained when larger-sized abrasive particles are used for polishing; (3) the respective optimum concentrations of the abrasive particle and the iron powder within the MCF polishing liquid exist in terms of the polishing characteristics; in the current experimental conditions, the optimum values for the concentrations of abrasive and iron powder were 20 and 20-40 wt.%, respectively.

The equations governing the steady flow of an incompressible MR fluid are implemented in the commercial code Ansys 14.0 Fluent which is a flexible CFD code based on finite volume approach. The governing differential equations describing the flow between parallel plates under magnetic field are solved numerically by using Fluent MHD module based on solving the magnetic induction equation method. The external applied magnetic field, B0, takes values between 0 and 1.5 T with 0.5 T step size, was applied to determine B0 effects on fluid flow. The numerical solutions for velocity and pressure distributions were obtained for different magnetic fields. It was observed that increase in B0 leads to decrease flow velocity.

  abstract = {Design of smart journal-bearing systems is an important issue that opens up the possibility for semi-active dynamic control of bearing behavior. Recent studies show that there is an increasing interest in designing hydrodynamically lubricated bearings using electro-rheological fluids (ERFs) or magneto-rheological fluids (MRFs). Both smart fluids behave like Bingham fluids, and thus the Bingham plastic model is used to describe the grease and the electro-rheological (ER) and magneto-rheological (MR) fluids behavior of the non-Newtonian fluid flow. The performance characteristics of a hydrodynamic journal bearing lubricated with a Bingham fluid are derived by means of three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3-D CFD) analysis. The FLUENT software package is used to calculate the hydrodynamic balance of the journal using the so-called “dynamic mesh” technique. The results obtained from the developed 3-D CFD model are found to be in very good agreement with experimental and analytical data from previous investigations on Bingham fluids. Journal-bearing performance characteristics, such as relative eccentricity, attitude angle, pressure distribution, friction coefficient, lubricant flow rate, and the angle of maximum pressure, are derived and presented for several length over diameter (L/D) bearing ratios and dimensionless shear numbers T0 of the Bingham fluid. The above diagrams are presented in the form of Raimondi and Boyd charts, and can easily be used in the design and analysis of journal bearings lubricated with Bingham fluids. The core profile formed in the bearing is also calculated and presented for various bearing eccentricities, L/D ratios, and shear numbers T0, and found to be in very good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical investigations. The analysis presented here leads to charts that could be used by the designer engineer to design smart journal bearings.},

  abstract  = {Magnetorheological (MR) elastomers are viscoelastic solids whose mechanical properties are controllable by applied magnetic fields. We have developed a family of MR elastomers, comprising micrometer-sized carbonyl iron particles embedded in natural rubber, that can be processed using conventional rubber-mixing techniques. By crosslinking the elastomer in the presence of an applied magnetic field, field-induced interparticle interactions promote the formation of particle chains and columns aligned along the field direction. The resulting composites possess field-dependent mechanical storage and loss moduli as well as anisotropic mechanical and magnetic properties. The field dependence of the mechanical properties of MR elastometers enables the construction of controllable elastomeric components, such as suspension bushings, that may prove advantageous in some automotive applications.},

We observe the formation of aggregates elongated in the direction of the field and whose length L is fixed by the thickness of the cell. The average radius b of these aggregates has been measured for L between 100 m and 700 m for two volume fractions =5% and =10%. In this range we find for a magnetorheological fluid composed of micronic superparamagnetic particles an experimental law b a(L/a)n with an exponent n0.670.04. We can recover this experimental law and predict the characteristic size of the aggregates from the knowledge of the magnetic permeability of the particles with a model based on the hypothesis of close packed aggregates. The agreement with the experiments is good especially at the lower volume fraction. Actually on a larger range of thicknesses our model predicts a continuous increase of this exponent towards a final value of one for large values of L/a.},

The anti-wear and friction-reducing properties of the amine salt as a silicone-based lubricating oil additive were evaluated using a four-ball tribotester. The results indicated that both the wear resistance and the load-carrying capacity of a silicone-based lubricating oil 4609 shock absorption liquid were improved and the friction coefficient was decreased by the additive. The wear scar, after being cleaned using an ultrasonic bath in petroleum ether, was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS).

  abstract = {Abrasive flow machining (AFM) is an abrasive-based precision finishing process used for achieving surface finish in micro and nano-level. The AFM polishes surfaces by extruding a visco-elastic media in contact with the workpiece. The media, also called a ‘flexible tool’, plays a key role in the performance of the process. Ultrasonic assisted abrasive flow machining (UAAFM) is a new variant of the AFM process in which the workpiece is subjected to mechanical vibration orthogonal to the media flow direction. In this process a high frequency, in the range of about 5–20 kHz, is given to the workpiece with the help of a piezo actuator and a specially designed fixture. The present work highlights on the possible behaviour of the tool (media) during UAAFM and its effect on the machining process through a computation based approach. Commercially available simulation tool was used to study the effect of the media in response to different set of machining conditions. The responses were evaluated in terms of changes in the fluid pressure, velocity profile of the fluid, temperature distribution in the working fluid and the possible wall shear on the work surface. A three-dimensional model was constructed for simulating the UAAFM process. The simulation shows that the abrasive particles tend to hit the target surface at an angle ‘θ’ which significantly affects the basic mechanisms involved and enhances the effectiveness of the process. The computed wall shear explains that the process will have higher finishing rate and hence the performance. The enhanced interaction of abrasive media in UAAFM while compared to simple AFM could be explained by the resultant pressure–velocity phenomena. Results show that while changes in the amplitude of applied vibration (10 μm and 50 μm) significantly affect the wall shear, the media velocity and pressure profiles are only marginally sensitive to this parameter. The simulation results also confirm that the rise in temperature during the process will not affect the media stability. Results have been discussed vis-a-vis the basic mechanism of the process through suitable illustrations.},

Based on the chain model, a yield shear stress model of magnetorheological fluids was proposed by introducing the exponential distribution to describe the distribution of angles between the direction of magnetic field and the chain formed by magnetic particles. The main influencing factors were considered in the model, such as magnetic flux density, intensity of magnetic field, particle size, volume fraction of particles, the angle of magnetic chain, and so on. The effect of magnetic flux density on the yield shear stress was discussed. The yield stress of aqueous Fe3O4 magnetreological fluids with volume fraction of 7.6% and 16.2% were measured by a device designed by ourselves. The results indicate that the proposed model can be used for calculation of yield shear stress with acceptable errors.},

  abstract = {Optical glasses used in a range of industrially important optoelectronic devices must be polished to nano-level roughness for proper device operation. Polishing process with magnetic compound fluid slurry (MCF polishing) under a rotary magnetic field is an influential candidate for the method to precisely polish optical glass. MCF slurry has been successfully utilized to polish a variety of materials, ranging from soft optical polymers to hard optical glasses. MCF was developed by mixing a magnetic fluid and a magnetorheological fluid with the same base solvent, and hence includes not only μm-sized iron particles but also nm-sized magnetite particles. To elucidate the behaviour of material removal in MCF polishing, this study measured the normal and shear forces generated in the polishing zone during polishing. From these measurements, the distributions of pressure P and shear stress τ were obtained. The distribution of material removal rate (MRR) was investigated through spot polishing of borosilicate glass. The effects of three process parameters, namely magnet revolution speed, MCF carrier rotational speed and working gap, on pressure P, shear stress τ and the MRR were also investigated. The results revealed that P is higher near the centre of the interacting area (i.e. the polishing spot centre) and the point of maximum shear stress τ appears at about 5 mm from the polishing spot centre. All of P, τ and MRR are sensitive to MCF carrier rotational speed and working gap but insensitive to magnet revolution speed. Shear stress is more sensitive to these process parameters than the pressure. Cross-sectional profiles of the polishing spots exhibit a characteristic symmetric W-shape; material removals are minimal at the spot centre and maximal at approximately 8.2–10.2 mm from the spot centre depending on the process parameters. MRR is proportional to the MCF carrier rotational speed and is negatively correlated with working gap. An MRR model involving both the pressure and shear stress in MCF polishing is proposed. In the model, MRR is more dominated by shear stress than by pressure.},

  abstract = {Compared with grinding, hard turning may induce a relatively deep compressive residual stress. However, the interactions between the residual stress profile and applied load and their effects on rolling contact stresses and strains are poorly understood, and are difficult to measure using the current experimental techniques due to the small-scale of the phenomena. A new 2-D finite element simulation model of bearing rolling contact has been developed, for the first time, to incorporate the machining-induced residual stress profile instead of only surface residual stresses. Three cases using the simulation model were assessed: (a) measured residual stress by hard turning, (b) measured residual stress by grinding, and (c) free of residual stress. It was found that distinct residual stress patterns hardly affect neither the magnitudes nor the locations of peak stresses and strains below the surface. However, they have a significant influence on surface deformations. The slope and depth of a compressive residual stress profile are key factors for rolling contact fatigue damage, which was substantiated by the available experimental data. Equivalent plastic strain could be a parameter to characterize the relative fatigue damage. The magnitudes of machining-induced residual stress are reduced in rolling contact. The predicted residual stress pattern and magnitude agree with the test data in general. In addition, rolling contact is more sensitive to normal load and residual stress pattern than tangential load.},

  abstract = {Hard turning has being used to make various mechanical components. Under certain cutting conditions, a white layer (WL) may form on the machined surface that could drastically affect a component's service life. The presence of WL causes great concerns in machining industry just because the WL effects on component life are not yet understood. This study presents a novel real-time acoustic emission (AE) based rolling contact fatigue (RCF) testing system to study the WL effects on component life. AISI 52100 bearing steels were machined to generate two distinct surfaces: free of white layer (NOWL) and with WL. The real life loading of contact pressures and rolling speeds was applied to the test specimens. The applied load throughout the experiment was in-process monitored using a load cell which enabling the record of a Hertzian pressure history during rolling contact. It was found that the RCF testing system is simple and inexpensive, but very sensitive to fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Compared with AE count rate, AE parameters such as energy, RMS, and amplitude are more sensitive to fatigue crack initiation and propagation in rolling contact. The NOWL samples are more resistive to fatigue crack initiation/propagation and, therefore, have a longer life when compared to the WL samples with equivalent surface finish.},

  abstract = {The fundamental knowledge of fatigue damage mechanism is necessary for understanding manufacturing process effects. The traditional method of artificially created surface defects may accelerate crack propagation and fatigue. However, the artificial defects will change the surface integrity and therefore alter the nature of fatigue damage, and thus, the fatigue damage in the presence of artificial defects in literature may not reflect the true mechanism of real-life fatigue processes. This paper studies the fatigue damage resulting from real-life rolling contact tests and finite element analysis of AISI 52100 steel and identifies the possible mechanisms for fatigue failure in the presence of process induced surface integrity. Rolling contact fatigue tests were then performed until surface spalling had occurred. Surface and subsurface fatigue damage of the samples was then characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface profiling. Two types of subsurface cracks were observed: main cracks that propagate parallel to the surface due to subsurface shear stress induced fracture/debonding of inclusions or second phase particles. Shear stress induced surface cracks propagate at shallow angles (≈ 35°) from the surface. Branching cracks eventually form and connect the main crack to surface. The crack SEM images show that the formation sequence of fatigue cracks is different for the turned and ground surfaces. Material loss (spalling) occurs as a combined effect of the main, surface, and branching cracks creating small discontinuous sections of material at the surface which are eventually lost after continued rolling.},

This study has shown that: (a) Hard turning with a fresh tool generates a “hook” shaped RS profile characterized by surface compressive RS and subsurface maximum compressive RS. While gentle grinding only generates maximum compressive RS at the surface and a shallow subsurface zone of compressive RS. The “hook” shaped RS profile with surface compressive RS contributes to a longer (∼40%) fatigue life of a machined surface. (b) A turned WL surface by a worn tool generates a high tensile stress in the area of the WL, but becomes more highly compressive in the deeper subsurface than the turned one without a WL. The high tensile RS at the surface leads to a much shorter (7.6 times) fatigue life. (c) A ground WL only shifts the RS to tension but hardly affect the basic shape of the profile for a ground fresh surface. The surface tensile RS coupled with near surface peak tensile RS produces the shortest (7.8 times) fatigue life.},

Although it is generally agreed that deep compressive residual stresses are beneficial to component life in rolling contact, the interactions between the residual stress profile, applied load, and surface material are poorly understood at present. With the input of process-induced residual stress profile instead of one point “surface” residual stress, a simulation model of rolling contact for hard-machined components has been developed by directly modeling the interaction between the roller and the machined surface, rather than moving the assumed Hertzian pressure and tangential surface traction across the surface of the traditional method. The equivalent plastic strain could characterize relative fatigue damage under the influence of process-induced residual stress. The slope of a compressive residual stress profile as well as its depth were identified as key factors for rolling contact fatigue damage. Rolling contact tend to reduce the initial compressive residual stress. The predicted residual stress pattern and magnitude agree with the test data in general. The increase of friction dramatically increases the magnitude of peak compressive residual stress but not its location. The normal load shifts the location of peak compressive residual stress much deeper below the surface.},

  abstract  = {Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a deterministic method for producing complex optics with figure accuracy &lt;50 nm and surface roughness &lt;1 nm. MRF was invented at the Luikov Institute of Heat and Mass Transfer in Minsk, Belarus in the late 1980s by a team led by William Kordonski. When the Soviet Union opened up, New York businessman Lowell Mintz was invited to Minsk in 1990 to explore possibilities for technology transfer. Mintz was told of the potential for MRF, but did not understand whether it had value. Mintz was referred to Harvey Pollicove at the Center for Optics Manufacturing of the University of Rochester. As a result of their conversation, they sent Prof. Steve Jacobs to visit Minsk and evaluate MRF. From Jacobs' positive findings, and with support from Lowell Mintz, Kordonski and his colleagues were invited in 1993 to work at the Center for Optics Manufacturing with Jacobs and Don Golini to refine MRF technology. A "preprototype" finishing machine was operating by 1994. Prof. Greg Forbes and doctoral student Paul Dumas developed algorithms for deterministic control of MRF. In 1996, Golini recognized the commercial potential of MRF, secured investment capital from Lowell Mintz, and founded QED Technologies. The first commercial MRF machine was unveiled in 1998. It was followed by more advanced models and by groundbreaking subaperture stitching interferometers for metrology. In 2006, QED was acquired by and became a division of Cabot Microelectronics. This paper recounts the history of the development of MRF and the founding of QED Technologies.},

These precursors were calcined at different temperatures ranging from 800 to 1100 °C for constant calcination time 2 h in a static air atmosphere. Effects of Fe3+/Sr2+ mole ratio, annealing temperature and pH on the formation, crystalline size, morphology and magnetic properties were systematically studied. The powders formed were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and VSM. The results obtained showed that the single-phase SrFe12O19 powders were achieved by decreasing the Fe3+/Sr2+ mole ratio from the stoichiometric value 12 to 9.23 and increasing the annealing temperature up to 900 °C for 2 h and pH 10. The maximum saturation magnetization (84.15 emu/g) was achieved by decreasing the Fe3+/Sr2+ mole ratio to 9.23 and the annealing temperature 1000 °C, annealing time 2 h and pH 10 due to the formation of a plate-like hexagonal-shape structure. Wide coercivities (2937–5607 Oe) can be obtained at different synthesis conditions. Moreover, the microstructure and the magnetic properties of the produced Sr–M ferrite powders were strongly dependent on he synthesis conditions.},

In these methods, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by co-precipitation, and the aging of nanoparticles was improved by applied magnetic field. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Thereafter, to enhance the compatibility between nanoparticles and water, an effective surface modification method was developed by grafting acrylic acid onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR, XRD, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetry (TG) were used to characterize the resultant sample. The testing results indicated that the polyacrylic acid chains have been covalently bonded to the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The effects of initiator dosage, monomer concentration, and reaction temperature on the characteristics of surface-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were investigated. Moreover, the Fe3O4-g-PAA hybrid nanoparticles were dispersed in water to form ferrofluids (FFs). The obtained FFs were characterized by UV–vis spectrophotometer, Gouy magnetic balance and laser particle-size analyzer. The testing results showed that the high-concentration FF had excellent stability, with high susceptibility and high saturation magnetization. The rheological properties of the FFs were also investigated using a rotating rheometer.},

The surface of MNPs was coated with oleate sodium as the primary layer and polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG-4000) as the secondary layer to improve the stability of water-based ferrofluids (FFs). The dosages of oleate sodium and PEG-4000 were found to have an important effect on increasing the solid content.

The Fe3O4 MNPs did not change through the preparation of FFs. Differential scanning calorimetry–thermogravimetry (DSC–TG) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis showed existence of two distinct surfactants on the particle surface. The concentrated and diluted FFs were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometer and excellent stability was found. The rheological measurements indicated that viscosity increased with the increase of solid content and applied magnetic field, but decreased with the increase of temperature.

The worn surfaces, lubricated by MRF under the effect of a magnetic field, change from circle or ellipse to irregular rectangle and the diameter of wear scar decreases.

Magnetic abrasive in the electromagnetic field was adsorbed on the cylindrical tube to become a flexible magnetic brush. It could generate adjustable pressure on the workpiece surface when the magnetic brush was grinding, and it could make the workpiece face polished to the mirror surface degree. This experiment used nonmagnetic stainless steel SUS304, following experimental design to conduct the experiments and to explore the effects of various parameters such as rotational speed, vibration frequency, current strength, abrasive, etc., on the surface finish characteristics. After statistical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was obtained, and then surface finish prediction system was constructed based on the significant parameters. System precision was about 97%.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a recursive compensation strategy for removing or generating an arbitrary profile during hydrodynamic polishing. Volume removal analysis suggests that, to remove an arbitrary error profile, the tool dwelling-time at the machining area can be designed to be a linear function of the error profile. The tool dwelling-time distribution is solved by the recursive method. This method may leave a residual error between the actual and desired profile because of the finite machining zone and the non-uniform machining rate distribution. The analysis indicates that the dominant factors in deciding residual error include the number of iterations, size of the machining zone, tool step size, and wavelength and amplitude of the error profile. The results indicate that a larger residual error occurs when the wavelengths of the error profile are smaller than the machining zone, and vice versa. By decreasing the tool step, the residual error is also reduced. Furthermore, error profile with small amplitude can be more easily eliminated. The residual error can also be significantly suppressed by the number of iterations, compared to that of the direct calculation of tool’s dwelling-time. Experimental results confirm that the analysis is correct and an arbitrary profile can be accurately removed by this recursive polishing strategy.},

This model is derived on the basis of force equilibrium, principle of minimum potential energy, Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) contact theory, and probability statistics. The simulation results indicate that variations in both particle size and tool surface irregularities change the contact length between the tool and particle and between the particle and work, and consequently influence the wear rates of tool and work. In this study, a given adhesion at the particle interfaces, for example, it reveals that a large particle size leads to reductions in the wear rate ratio between tool and work. On the other hand, an increase in tool surface irregularities decreases the wear rate ratio between tool and work. The experimental results show that the qualitative trends of wear rate ratio versus particle size and tool surface irregularities can be well predicted by analytical analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a process control strategy for removing small-wavelength form error during hydrodynamic polishing, that is, by planning a tool dwelling time appropriate to accurately remove the form error. Volume removal analysis suggests that removal of an arbitrary error profile requires the tool to dwell at a given position for a period that is a linear function of the error profile. The dwelling-time distribution of the tool is solved by the non-negative least squares method. The residual error between the actual and desired profile is induced by this strategy. Residual error occurs mainly at the peaks and valleys of the profile, in addition to the boundaries of the machining area. Results indicate that the dominant factors in deciding residual error are the size of the machining zone, tool step, and wavelength and amplitude of the error profile. It is shown that larger residual error occurs in bands with wavelengths smaller than the machining zone, and vice versa. If the wavelength is sufficiently large, a small tool step effectively reduces the residual error. Furthermore, large variations in the amplitude of the error profile can be effectively reduced when the wavelength is large. Experimental results confirm that the proposed polishing strategy can remove an arbitrary profile and automatically reduce the small-wavelength errors. However, it is not effective when the wavelength of the error profile is near the size of the machining zone.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the stability and redispersibility of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These are disperse systems where the solid is constituted by ferro- or ferri-magnetic microparticles. Upon the application of external magnetic field, they experience rapid and reversible increases in yield stress and viscosity. The problem considered here is first of all the determination of their stability against sedimentation, an essential issue in their practical application. Although this problem is typically faced through the addition of thixotropic agents to the liquid medium, in this work, we propose the investigation of the effect of magnetic nanoparticles addition, so that the dispersion medium is in reality a ferrofluid. It is found that a volume fraction of nanoparticles not higher than 3% is enough to provide a long-lasting stabilization to MRFs containing above 30% iron microparticles. In the, in fact unavoidable, event of settling, the important point is the ease of redispersion of the sediment. This is indirectly evaluated in the present investigation by measuring the penetration force in the suspension, using a standard hardness needle. Again, it is found that the nanoparticles addition produces soft sediments by avoiding short-range attractions between the large iron particles. Finally, the performance of the designed MRFs is evaluated by obtaining their steady-state rheograms for different volume fractions of magnetite and different magnetic field strengths. The yield stress is found to be strongly field-dependent, and it can achieve the high values expected in standard magnetorheological fluids but with improved stability and redispersibility.},

  year      = {2005},
  abstract  = {This thesis makes use of microindentation, nanoindentation and nanoscratching methods to better understand the mechanical properties of single crystalline silicon, calcium fluoride, and magnesium fluoride. These properties are measured and are used to predict the materials response to material removal, specifically by grinding and polishing, which is a combination of elastic, plastic and fracture processes. The hardness anisotropy during Knoop microindentation, hardness from nanoindentation, and scratch morphology from nanoscratching are reported. This information is related to the surface microroughness from grinding. We show that mechanical property relationships that predict the surface roughness from lapping and deterministic microgrinding of optical glasses are applicable to single crystals. We show the range of hardness from some of the more common crystallographic faces. Magnesium fluoride, having a tetragonal structure, has 2-fold hardness anisotropy. Nanoindentation, as expected provides higher hardness than microindentation, but anisotropy is not observed. Nanoscratching provides the scratch profile during loading, after the load has been removed, and the coefficient of friction during the loading. Ductile and brittle mode scratching is present with brittle mode cracking being orientation specific. Subsurface damage SSD) measurements are made using a novel process known as the MRF technique. Magnetorheological finishing is used to polish spots into the ground surface where SSD can be viewed. SSD is measured using an optical microscope and knowledge of the spot profile. This technique is calibrated with a previous technique and implemented to accurately measure SSD in single crystals. The data collected are compared to the surface microroughness of the ground surface, resulting in an upper bound relationship. The results indicate that SSD is always less than 1.4 times the peak-to-valley surface microroughness for single crystals regardless of the grinding conditions or mechanical properties. Single crystals have greater strain rate effects associated than optical glasses. Hence, the strain rate is investigated during grinding by applying more aggressive process parameters and measuring the resulting surface finish. It is observed that while there are weak materials and crystallographic orientation effects from process parameters, the changes in strain rate do not affect the surface finish of these materials.},

  abstract = {Micro-/nano-machining (abbreviated as MNM) processes are classified mainly in two classes: traditional and advanced. Majority of the traditional MNM processes are embedded abrasive or fixed geometry cutting tool type processes. Conversely, majority of the advanced MNM processes are loose flowing abrasive based processes in which abrasive orientation and its geometry at the time of interaction with the workpiece is not fixed. There are some MNM processes which do not come under the abrasive based MNM category, for example, laser beam machining, electron beam machining, ion beam machining, and proton beam machining. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of various flowing abrasive based MNM processes only. It also proposes a generalized mechanism of material removal for these processes. The MNM processes discussed in this paper include: Abrasive Flow Finishing (AFF), Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF), Magnetorheological Finishing, Magnetorheological Abrasive Flow Finishing, Elastic Emission Machining (EEM) and Magnetic Float Polishing. EEM results in surface finish of the order of sub-nanometer level by using the nanometer size abrasive particles with the precisely controlled forces. Except two (AFF and EEM), all other processes mentioned above use a medium whose properties can be controlled externally with the help of magnetic field. This permits to control the forces acting on an abrasive particle hence the amount of material removed is also controlled. This class of processes is capable to produce surface roughness value of 8 nm or lower. Using better force control and still finer abrasive particles, some of these processes may result in the sub-nanometer surface roughness value on the finished part. Understanding the mechanism of material removal and rotation of the abrasives in these processes will help in rationalization of some of the experimental observations which otherwise seem to be contradicting with the established theories. It also explains why a magnet used in MAF should have a slot in it even though the area under the slot has “non-machining” zone. It elaborates based on the experimental observations why to use pulse D.C. power supply in MAF in place of smooth D.C. power supply.},

  abstract  = {The surface finishing techniques can be divided into two categories: traditional and advanced. To overcome some of the problems of traditional finishing techniques, hybridized processes have been evolved by the researchers. Some of the advanced finishing processes that have been reviewed are abrasive flow machining (AFM), magnetorheological finishing (MRF), magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (MRAFF), magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), chemo mechanical polishing (CMP), etc. Most of these processes have been developed in the recent past and they can be employed to produce optical, mechanical, and electronic components with micrometer or sub-micrometer form accuracy and surface roughness within nanometer range with hardly any surface defects. However for large size flat components, MAF seems to be the most suitable finishing process. In MAF, DC power supply is given to the electromagnet hence intermixing of ferromagnetic abrasive particles during the process does not take place and the worn out cutting edges keep interacting with the workpiece surface. As a result, the finishing rate is quite low. The use of pulsed DC power supply to the electromagnet results in pulsating flexible magnetic abrasive brush (P-FMAB), which substantially enhances the finishing rate. The on-line measurement of the forces has helped in understanding the mechanism of material removal during Static-FMAB (S-FMAB) and Pulsating-FMAB. The magnitude of normal magnetic force (originating indentations) in P-FMAB has been found to be dynamic in nature and substantially high in magnitude as compared to S-FMAB.},

  abstract  = {Surface roughness plays an important role in product quality, particularly in situations such as precision fits and high-strength applications. Magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) is an advanced finishing process in which the cutting force is controlled by magnetic field. This process is capable of giving nanometer-scale surface finish. This paper describes modeling, simulation and analysis of the profiles of the surface obtained after MAF. The real-life surface profile is so complicated that a single parameter can not give a full description of surface quality. However, in the present work, the height of the surface profile distribution before MAF is considered to be Gaussian. The surface roughness model is developed which computes center-line average (R-a) surface roughness. The validity of this model is checked by comparison with the experimental results. A series of numerical experiments are performed using finite-element methods and surface roughness models of the process, to study the effect of flux density, height of working gap, size of magnetic abrasive particles and rotational speed of magnetic pole on the surface quality. Based upon the results, we concluded that R-a values of the finished workpiece surface decrease with increase in magnetic flux density, size of magnetic abrasive particles and rotational speed of flexible magnetic abrasive brush. On the other hand, the surface roughness values increase with increase in the working gap.},

The process uses the electrochemical anodic reactions on an electrically conductive workpiece under an electric field and an electrolytic solution soaked in the same carbonyl iron (CI) particles as those used in the conventional MR polishing process, where the yield stress is controllable through the external magnetic field. Through experiments, we show that the new process is suitable for polishing three-dimensionally configured workpieces made of very hard materials, such as glassy carbon (GC), that are very difficult to polish using conventional processes. To examine the benefits and limitations of the proposed polishing process, a preliminary electrochemical experiment was performed on GC specimens, and the characteristics of the resultant electrochemical reactions in an aqueous electrolytic solution were investigated. The effectiveness of the proposed process was then demonstrated by polishing GC molds designed to replicate a glass channel-mixer structure used for biochemical inspection applications.

This paper proposes a new deburring process utilizing a magnetorheological fluid and applies it to the production of micromolds. A magnetorheological fluid is a functional fluid with a variable yield stress that is controlled by an external magnetic field. The proposed process utilizes two material removal mechanisms induced by the magnetorheological fluid flow. Extensive yielding of material is effective for deburring sheet-shaped burrs, and abrasive wear is effective for deburring protrusion-shaped burrs. A process model was developed to describe the effectiveness of each mechanism for specific burr geometries. The performance of the proposed method was verified experimentally. Metal burrs with a height of 200 μm and thickness of 1 μm were removed successfully with extensive yielding and abrasive wear. Burrs shorter than a few micrometers could be removed only by abrasive wear. The material removal behaviors of sheet-shaped and protrusion shaped burrs matched the proposed process model well.},

  abstract = {Magnetorheological (MR) fluid is used for various applications due to its controllable viscosity. To predict the behavior of MR fluid under certain three-dimensional (3D) magnetic and shear strain fields, it is essential to model the fluid in an appropriate manner. The behavioral models used in the previous research, however, have serious limitations because most of them oversimplify the inter-particle interactions and employ assumptions valid only under specific geometric configurations and field conditions. In this study, a new model that can predict the behavior of MR fluid under arbitrary 3D magnetic and shear strain fields is proposed. The present work considers an MR fluid configured as a 3D infinite lattice structure. Using the proposed model, the shear stress components themselves, not the dipolar interaction energy, are calculated directly to avoid the mathematical singularity otherwise encountered. The resulting stress functions of the proposed model are transformed into rapidly convergent functions using the Lekner summation method. Finally, the characteristics of the stiffened MR fluid under a magnetic field are investigated using the transformed functions. Numerical computations on the original and transformed functions are performed and compared under selected conditions to ensure the validity and prove the high convergence efficiency of the proposed model.},

Surface quality influences characteristics such as fatigue strength, wear rate, corrosion resistance, etc. Hard turning allows manufacturers to simplify their processes and still achieve the desired surface finish quality. There are various parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, and tool nose radius that are known to have a large impact on surface quality. This paper describes how feed rate and nose radius affect the surface integrity and fatigue life in turning. The results show that the effect of residual stress on fatigue life is more pronounced than the effect of surface roughness.

The size of magnetite particles is nearly 300 nm and the volume fraction of the magnetic particles is in the range of 0.003–0.03. The particle concentration dependence of the suspension viscosity yields the intrinsic viscosity [η], which varies from 25.6 at 5 s−1 to 5.1 at 400 s−1. The yield stress and the infinite shear viscosity of the suspension increase non-linearly as the particle concentration ϕ increases. We examine the effect of process conditions such as milling time and amount of dispersant on the viscosity behavior of the suspension. As milling time elapses, yield stress and low shear viscosity decrease and then reach constant values while the infinite shear viscosity remains constant. When oleic acid is added as a dispersant, the yield stress and low shear viscosity of the suspension show minimum values as the amount of oleic acid increases. These results agree with experimental results of sedimentation tests, which enable us to estimate the aggregate size of magnetic suspension. The yield stress and the low shear viscosity of the magnetic suspension are found to be useful in evaluating the dispersion state of the magnetic suspension.},

Magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (MRAFF) process provides better control over rheological properties of abrasive laden magnetorheological finishing medium. Magnetorheological (MR) polishing fluid comprises of carbonyl iron powder and silicon carbide abrasives dispersed in the viscoplastic base of grease and mineral oil; it exhibits change in rheological behaviour in presence of external magnetic field. This smart behaviour of MR-polishing fluid is utilized to precisely control the finishing forces, hence final surface finish. A hydraulically powered experimental setup is designed to study the process characteristics and performance. The setup consists of two MR-polishing fluid cylinders, two hydraulic actuators, electromagnet, fixture and supporting frame. Experiments were conducted on stainless steel workpieces at different magnetic field strength to observe its effect on final surface finish. No measurable change in surface roughness is observed after finishing at zero magnetic field. However, for the same number of cycles the roughness reduces gradually with the increase of magnetic field. This validates the role of rheological behaviour of magnetorheological polishing fluid in performing finishing action.},

The time evolution of structural formation is examined by the mean number of neighbors under fast and slow aggregation regions. It was found that the electrolyte ionic strength affects the kinetic pattern of colloidal aggregation. Under the high electrolyte ionic strength conditions (fast aggregation), the selective aggregation of the least stable single component can take place in the early stage, while the other component is enriched in this least stable component in the later stage. With the ionic strength decreasing (towards the slow aggregation), the hybrid aggregation (selective aggregation and heteroaggregation) gradually dominates the aggregation kinetics. Also in the early stage, this evolves to the heteroaggregation of different components under lower ionic strength conditions. The volume fraction has no obvious influence on this kinetic pattern in the early stage.},

In this paper, Taguchi method [Genichi Taguchi, Taguchi Methods-Research and Development, ASI Press, Dearborn, MI (1992); K.E. Dehnad, Quality Control, Robust Design, and the Taguchi Method, Brooks/Cole, CA (1989)] is applied for optimization of the finishing conditions. Surface finish parameters, namely, Ra (arithmetic average) and Rt (peak-to-valley height) are considered as criteria for optimization. Important parameters identified that influence the surface quality generated during final mechanical polishing for a given workmaterial with a given abrasive (material and grain size) are (i) the polishing force; (ii) the abrasive concentration; and (iii) the polishing speed. Experimental results indicate that for the surface finish, both Ra and Rt, the polishing force parameter is the most significant. However, for the surface finish Ra, the polishing force parameter is the most significant, followed by polishing speed and then the abrasive concentration; while for the surface finish Rt, the polishing force parameter is the most significant followed by the abrasive concentration and then the polishing speed. The experimental results also indicate that within the range of parameters evaluated, a high level of polishing force, a low level of abrasive concentration, and a high level of polishing speed are desirable for improving both Ra and Rt. A comparison of the results obtained by the Taguchi method with single parameter (i.e., one parameter by one parameter) variation using a fine SiC abrasive (1 mu m) yielded similar conclusions regarding optimum conditions [M. Jiang, Finishing of Advanced Ceramics, PhD thesis (under preparation), Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Oklahoma State University (1997)].

  abstract = {This study investigates a new semi-fixed-abrasive, ultra-fine finishing method for optical glass using a magneticcompound fluid (MCF) wheel. This MCF wheel generates a thin, uniform MCF slurry layer on the entire circumferentialsurface of a ring-shaped permanent magnet placed between two non-magnetic plates. The MCF slurry is composed ofnano-sized magnetite particles, micron-sized iron particles, several 10 μm-sized α-cellulose fibres and sub-micron-sizedabrasive particles that react to the magnetic field. Following modifications to the design of the MCF, experiments wereconducted to evaluate the performance of the modified wheel in spot-polishing fused silica glass. This paper describes themodifications to the MCF wheel and the experimental setup used to measure its performance. The improvement of themodified wheel over the unmodified wheel in terms of material removal and surfaces roughness is experimentallyconfirmed. The effects of the wheel rotational speed and the clearance between the wheel and the workpiece on materialremoval and the workpiece surface roughness are investigated. The polishing forces are measured, the structure of the MCFslurry is examined and the magnetic field distribution is analysed. A model of material removal in polishing with themodified MCF wheel is developed. The results indicate the following: (1) more material was removed, i.e., greater spotdepths, and better surfaces were obtained in the regions that were near the edges of the magnet; (2) the modified MCF wheelperformed much better than the unmodified wheel in terms of material removal and surface roughness, e.g., 3.1 μm vs. 1.7μm for the maximum spot depth, 0.04 mm3 vs. 0.0088 mm3 for the volume of material removed and Ra = 5.624 nm vs.14.67 nm for the surface roughness; (3) a better work surface and greater material removal were obtained with smallerworking clearances and higher wheel rotational speeds.},

  abstract  = {It was mainly during the last two decades that the theory of homogenization or averaging of partial differential equations took shape as a distinct mathe matical discipline. This theory has a lot of important applications in mechanics of composite and perforated materials, filtration, disperse media, and in many other branches of physics, mechanics and modern technology. There is a vast literature on the subject. The term averaging has been usually associated with the methods of non linear mechanics and ordinary differential equations developed in the works of Poincare, Van Der Pol, Krylov, Bogoliubov, etc. For a long time, after the works of Maxwell and Rayleigh, homogeniza tion problems for· partial differential equations were being mostly considered by specialists in physics and mechanics, and were staying beyond the scope of mathematicians. A great deal of attention was given to the so called disperse media, which, in the simplest case, are two-phase media formed by the main homogeneous material containing small foreign particles (grains, inclusions). Such two-phase bodies, whose size is considerably larger than that of each sep arate inclusion, have been discovered to possess stable physical properties (such as heat transfer, electric conductivity, etc.) which differ from those of the con stituent phases. For this reason, the word homogenized, or effective, is used in relation to these characteristics. An enormous number of results, approximation formulas, and estimates have been obtained in connection with such problems as electromagnetic wave scattering on small particles, effective heat transfer in two-phase media, etc.},

Under boundary lubrication, delamination and abrasive wear predominate and white layers are found to develop from isolated plastically deformed zones beneath the sliding surface.

The results show that the hardened layer is consisted of completely hardened region and transitional region. The completely hardened region is composed of mixed martensite, residual austerities and a little carbide. There were no remarkable effects of the depth of cut and original structure on the martensite configuration and micro-hardness value in completely hardened region. The micro-hardness value of the completely hardened region can be up to 750-780HV. However, microstructure of the transitional region varies with different original structure. When the depth of cut or uniformity of original structure increase, the hardened layer depth increases accordingly. Thus in practical production, it should adopt large depth of cut or use the original structure with quenched and tempered to increase the hardened layer depth.},

Magnetic composite particles used are iron oxide-coated polymer composite particles, which were synthesized through in situ coating of iron oxide onto pre-existing polymer particles by the reduction of ferrous fluids. For a uniform and bulk coating of iron oxide, the porous structure was introduced into the substrate polymer particles through a two-step seeded polymerization method. Moreover, surface cyano-functionality was born from acrylonitrile unit of substrate polymer and it played an important role in obtaining successful uniform coating. The structure of the composite particle was analyzed by using a thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and a X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The magnetization property of the particle was also observed. Then, the rheological properties of monodisperse magnetorheological (MR) suspensions of magnetic composite particles were examined under a magnetic field using a parallel-plate type commercial rheometer. From the rheological measurements, it was found that MR properties of the magnetic composite suspensions are dependent on the iron oxide content and the fluid composition.},

  abstract = {The use of magnetorheological fluids for finishing is one of the most promising smart processes for the fabrication of ultra-fine surfaces, particularly three-dimensional millimeter or micrometer structures. This process is not readily applicable to hard-surface materials, like an Al2O3–TiC hard disk slider, if a conventional rotating tool is used. This is due to the rotational speed and the resulting actual impressed abrasion energy limits, and the consequent low efficiency of the material removal rate. In this study, the main mechanism responsible for the decrease of the material removal rate on hard materials for a wheel-type magnetorheological finishing process is examined, both theoretically and experimentally, and a solution to this problem is devised via two approaches. The first uses a rectilinear alternating motion to improve processing conditions, and the second focuses on the use of more effective abrasives, namely magnetizable abrasives made of iron powders sintered with carbon nanotubes, which are new abrasives that have not yet been introduced in the field of surface finishing. Furthermore, it is shown that these abrasives increase the lifetime of consumables (magnetorheological fluid and abrasives) and the material removal rate.},

The magnetic performance of the molded part depends on the orientation of magnetic particles. In order to induce specific orientation of anisotropic magnetic particles in the molded product, external magnetic flux is applied to the mold cavity during the filling and cooling stages. In general, rheological behavior of the magnetic feedstock is significantly affected by external magnetic flux, flow shear rate, temperature, powder volume fraction and powder size distribution. For computational analysis of magnetic micro powder injection molding process, one of the most challenging issues has been the magneto-rheological modeling of the feedstock to describe flow and deformation behavior of feedstock under applied external magnetic flux.

Experiments were planned and performed based on Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Analysis of variance has been used to analyze the experimental data. The analysis of the experimental data showed that normal finishing forces is affected most significantly by lower and upper working gap and finishing torque is effected mostly by the lower working gap and rotational speed of the magnetic disk.

Based on the experimental results obtained, S/N ratio and ANOVA analyses were made to identify the significant process parameters to improve the percentage improvement of surface roughness (%ΔRa). From the results it is observed that the process parameters like voltage applied to the electromagnet, machining gap, rotational speed of electromagnet followed by abrasive size are significant to improve the %ΔRa. Based on the process parameters selected from the S/N ratio analysis and ANOVA analysis, a fuzzy logic model has been developed to predict the %ΔRa. To develop the fuzzy model, four membership functions based on the four process parameters are assigned to be connected with each input of the model. The developed fuzzy model is tested using three different set of process parameters values that are not used in already existing experimental data set. It is found that the developed fuzzy model has a close relation with the experimental values with the maximum deviations of 7.16%.},

First a brief inspection of the theory of tuned vibration absorbers (TVAs) is presented. After that mechanical TVAs are presented more carefully. In the same chapter the following are also handled: virtual absorbers, absorbers with adjustable damping, and Helmholtz resonators. Own chapter is allocated for multiple TVAs whose idea is to replace adjustability by adding several TVAs to primary system to damp out vibrations in the wide frequency band. The review section is completed by presenting smart material TVAs, which include, e.g., piezoelectric materials, shape-memory alloys, electrorheological and magnetorheological materials of fluids. An adjustable Helmholtz resonator in a low pressure hydraulic system is presented in Sec. 5. Experiments verify the efficiency of the damping character of the adjustable Helmholtz resonator whose resonant frequency can be varied.},

  abstract = {The present study theoretically analyzes the Couette–Poiseuille flow of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid flowing through a thin channel, where the externally applied magnetic field can be spatially non-uniform. To this end, a magnetic field-dependent (MFD) bi-viscosity constitutive model is newly proposed and employed in conjunction with the Navier wall slip condition. In this analysis, the MFD yield stress and MFD bi-viscosity are considered to be linearly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, which obeys the inverse cube law of the normal distance from the magnetic tool. Through a succession of detailed analyses, a total of eight types of Couette–Poiseuille flows are found, including three new flow types that cannot be described with a classical bi-viscosity constitutive model. The analytic solutions for all types of these flows are derived along with the restriction conditions for their existence. Furthermore, the possibility of the existence of these eight types of MFD bi-viscous flows is investigated under four separate characteristic conditions that determine the configuration of the induced magnetic field in the channel. The behaviors of the MFD bi-viscous flows are then investigated through the use of a parametric diagram composed of the Bingham number (Bn) and the Couette number (Co), i.e., Bn–Co diagram, for which some parameters such as the effective distance, nominal viscosity ratio, and wall slip condition are changed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the first analytical endeavor into the fluid dynamic modeling of an MR polishing process is reported. The velocity and shear stress fields of an MR fluid running through a thin slippery channel with a slightly varying height are analytically solved using a bi-viscosity constitutive model and a Navier slip model. Estimations of the mechanical power density and the total power per unit depth applied onto the channel surfaces are also presented. Analytical solutions for the Couette–Poiseuille flow behavior of a bi-viscous fluid flowing through either parallel or non-uniform channels are obtained, and the associated necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing a total of 5 types of flow are derived. The behaviors of the fluid are examined through the use of a parametric diagram of Bingham number (Bn) and Couette number (Co), i.e., Bn–Co or 1/Bn–1/Co diagram, by changing the geometric and operating conditions. Using these diagrams, variations in the rheological characteristics of the flow are investigated in great detail, with a special focus on the movement of the pseudo-core region. Finally, the mechanical power density field obtained for the flow in a converging–diverging channel is used to explain the wear mechanism in the MR polishing process. The effects of the power density field and the total power on the material removal rate (MRR) and the within-workpiece nonuniformity (WIWNU) with respect to various geometric and operating conditions are evaluated.},

  abstract = {A new kind of polishing method for mirror surface using the electrorheological (ER) fluid is presented. ER fluid is colloidal suspension and stiffens into semi-solid when subjected to an electric field. In this study, the mixture of the ER fluid and abrasives is used as polishing slurry. When the ER fluid is placed at the inter-face between a part and a moving platen, the friction force increases with the applied voltage. Since the polymeric ER particles separating two surfaces attract neighboring fine abrasives along the electric field across the gap, making the abrasives participate in material removal, they replace roles of pad used in a common mirror polishing. This paper analyzes the friction characteristics of the ER fluid at the sliding interface experimentally, and the behavior of the ER particles at the interface with and without the application of an electric field is observed optically. In addition, material removal rate of single crystal silicon according to the electric field strength is evaluated using the mixture of the ER fluid and diamond powders for a few conditions of different velocities and normal pressures. At last. average surface roughness of 2.9 nm is obtained as a result of the polishing of silicon surface whose average roughness is about 50 nm with the 0.25 mum diamond-mixed ER fluid.

To obtain information on both, the individual sublayers the coating consists of and the interfacial substrate region, it is necessary to apply different methods which are complementary with respect to the accessible information depth. Based on the concept of an ‘equivalent thickness’ for describing angle-dispersive diffraction in multilayer structures, a method is proposed that allows for the evaluation of steep intra — as well as interlayer stress gradients within the upper sublayers of multilayer coating systems. Furthermore, energy-dispersive diffraction is shown suitable to detect the residual stress distribution in the near interface substrate zone beneath the coatings. The applicability of the approaches introduced here is demonstrated by the example of cemented carbide WC/Co cutting tools being coated by chemical vapor deposition with sequences of Al2O3/TiCN sublayers.},

  abstract = {Surface behavior of the commonly found minerals in nickel laterite ores — quartz, magnetite, hematite and goethite — was investigated using electroacoustic measurements. The goal was to assess the surface potentials as single minerals and in mixed systems to understand possible interactions between particles in laterite slurries. Surface potentials were evaluated according to the electroacoustic theory with the understanding that a direct relationship existed between zeta potential and electroacoustic sonic amplitude (ESA) values. Results were evaluated using Bruinsma's equations. Measured (actual) and calculated ESA values were compared to determine whether the mixed systems remained dispersed or a tendency towards heterocoagulation existed over a range of pHs. For all mixed systems the behavior of the system was affected by the mineral of higher proportion in the mixture. For the fine quartz–magnetite system, no heterocoagulation was observed at all proportions of quartz and magnetite over the entire pH range. In the fine quartz–hematite and fine quartz–goethite systems a tendency towards heterocoagulation was observed with increase in quartz. The effect of the particle size was also investigated using coarse quartz–magnetite mixtures. A higher tendency towards heterocoagulation was observed with coarser quartz. The amount of quartz was found critical for the rheology of laterite slurries, determining the state of dispersion and/or heterocoagulation in the slurry.},

Experimental verification, however, has been complicated by the high polydispersity of the available ferrofluids, and the morphology of the dipolar chains was left to the imagination. We now present the concentration-聽and field-dependent magnetization of particularly well-defined ferrofluids, with a low polydispersity, three different average particle sizes, and with dipolar chains that were imaged with and without magnetic field using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. At low concentrations, the magnetization curves obey the Langevin equation for noninteracting dipoles. Magnetization curves for the largest particles strongly deviate from the Langevin equation but quantitatively agree with a recently developed mean-field model that incorporates the field-dependent formation and alignment of flexible dipolar chains. The combination of magnetic results and in聽situ electron microscopy images provides original new evidence for the effect of dipolar chains on the field-dependent magnetization of ferrofluids.},

The concept is to suppress the dominant vibration upon its emergence by variable damping or to force the harmful vibration morph into less harmful by different damper position. A magneto-rheological (MR) fluid damper is designed with adjustable damping capability to counteract emerging vibration. A series of experimental investigations are carried out on the BTA deep hole drilling process. The experimental results show that the adjustable MR damping brings down the vibration in all applications with different suppression effect. A relative optimal suppression can always be found. The suppressed vibration experiences a frequency shift which sheds light on the possible avoidance of matching of unwelcome frequency. Different damper locations have different but consistent suppression results which foresee a possibility of forcing the mode of vibration into less harmful one. A potential precision or targeted suppression of vibration upon its emergence is thus possible.},

At the same time it is common practice to present and analyze magnetorheological characteristics as a function of the applied magnetic field. Uncertainty of an influence function in magnetorheology hampers interpretation of data obtained with different measurement configurations. It was shown in this paper that rheological response of magnetorheological fluid to the applied magnetic field is defined by the sample's actual (internal) magnetic field intensity, which, in turn, depends on sample geometry and field orientation all other factors being equal. Utilization of the sample's actual field as an influence function in magnetorheology allows proper interpretation of data obtained with different measuring system configurations. Optimization of the actual internal field is a promising approach in designing of energy efficient magnetorheological devices.},

  abstract  = {Proper functionality of devices and processes based on (MR) fluids greatly depends, along with other factors, on stability of fluid characteristics such as concentration of magnetic particles and magnetic properties of the particles. The concentration of magnetic particles may change due to evaporation or leakage of carrier fluid, as well as particle sedimentation. Magnetic properties may change due to temperature, corrosion of particles or irreversible aggregation. In-line noninvasive monitoring of particle concentration and magnetic properties allows, in one way or another, compensation for the impact of destabilizing factors and provides system stable output. Two novel methods of in-line measurement of MR fluid magnetic permeability or magnetic particle concentration are considered in this presentation. The first one is based on the principle of mutual inductance and is intended for monitoring MR fluid flowing in pipes or channels. In the second one, permeability is measured by a flash-mount sensor which reacts on changes in the reluctance of the MR fluid layer adjacent to the wall. The use of the methods for stabilization of the material removal rate in high precision finishing process employing aqueous MR fluid is discussed.},

  abstract  = {Conformal (or freeform) and steep concave optics are important classes of optics that are difficult to finish using conventional techniques due to mechanical interferences and steep local slopes. One suitable way to polish these classes of optics is by using a jet of abrasive/fluid mixture. The energy required for polishing may be supplied by the radial spread of a liquid jet, which impinges a surface to be polished. Such fluid flow may generate sufficient surface shear stress to provide material removal in the regime of chemical mechanical polishing. Once translated into a polishing technique, this unique tool may resolve a challenging problem of finishing steep concave surfaces and cavities. A fundamental property of a fluid jet is that it begins to lose its coherence as the jet exits a nozzle. This is due to a combination of abruptly imposed longitudinal and lateral pressure gradients, surface tension forces, and aerodynamic disturbance. This results in instability of the flow over the impact zone and consequently polishing spot instability. To be utilized in deterministic high precision finishing of remote objects, a stable, relatively high-speed, low viscosity fluid jet, which remains collimated and coherent before it impinges the surface to be polished, is required. A method of jet stabilization has been proposed, developed, and demonstrated whereby the round jet of magnetorheological fluid is magnetized by an axial magnetic field when it flows out of the nozzle. It has been experimentally shown that a magnetically stabilized round jet of magnetorheological (MR) polishing fluid generates a reproducible material removal function (polishing spot) at a distance of several tens of centimeters from the nozzle. The interferometrically derived distribution of material removal for an axisymmetric MR Jet? , which impinges normal to a plane glass surface, coincides well with the radial distribution of rate of work calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Polishing results support the assertion that the MR Jet finishing process may produce high precision surfaces on glass and single crystals. The technology is most attractive for the finishing of complex shapes like freeform optics, steep concaves, and cavities.},

In this process a ball end shape of MR polishing fluid is generated at the tip surface of the rotating tool which is used as a finishing spot. This paper is focused on surface finishing and performance evaluation of a typical three-dimensional ferromagnetic workpiece using a ball end magnetorheological finishing process. A typical 3D workpiece surfaces were made by milling process at different angles of projection such as flat, 30°, 45° and curve surfaces. The experiments were performed on these typical workpiece surfaces by ball end MR finishing setup to study the effect of number of finishing passes on final surface roughness. The experiments were also performed on a flat ground surface to study the process performance as compared with the milled workpiece surfaces. The finite element analysis has been done to study the distribution of magnetic flux density at tip surface of the tool with an inserted typical 3D workpiece surfaces. When these typical workpiece surfaces were finished by proposed MR finishing process, the surface roughness were reduced as low as 16.6 nm, 30.4 nm, 71 nm and 123.7 nm respectively on flat, 30°, 45° and curve surfaces for 60 passes of finishing. The roughness of flat ground surface was reduced as low as 19.7 nm for 120 min of finishing. The experimental results demonstrated that the newly developed ball end magnetorheological finishing process was effective in finishing typical 3D ferromagnetic workpiece surfaces.},

  abstract  = {Freeform complex surfaces have become an inevitable part of many devices to perform specific functions. Some of these components require nanolevel surface roughness value to meet the desired requirements in their applications. Finishing of freeform surfaces to nanometer surface roughness value is always difficult for any process. Rotational-magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (R-MRAFF) process has been applied so far for finishing internal surfaces of relatively simple geometry. In this work, an attempt has been made to improve external topography of freeform surfaces using this process. Large hydrodynamic pressure coupled with magnetic fluid is the principal idea behind these experiments. A smooth mirror like finished surface is achieved with improved finishing rate (nanometer/min) by controlling two motions (axial and rotational) simultaneously on stainless steel workpiece similar to knee joint implant. Magnetorheological polishing fluid with different mesh sizes of abrasive particles and at different extrusion pressures is used to reduce final surface roughness value, to increase uniformity of surface finish on the freeform surface and to enhance finishing rate. Surface roughness ranging from 35 to 78 nm is achieved at various locations as compared to larger variation in Ra value obtained in the earlier research work.},

  abstract = {When a ferromagnetic suspension flows through a capillary placed between two small strong permanent magnets, the magnetic force acts upon the non-magnetic (silica) particles dispersed in a ferrofluid and they tend to be extruded from the zone of high magnetic field. Particles get concentrated at the entrance section between magnets and form a plug. The increase of hydraulic resistance is due to the relative motion between particulate and ferrofluid phases in the presence of a field. If we keep the pressure difference constant, the flow rate will decrease when the field is applied and can eventually completely stop. In order to restart the flow a pressure difference, high enough to push the silica plug out of the capillary, is needed. The critical pressure of the flow blockage is nearly two times less than the pressure of the flow onset, both pressures being independent of the particle concentration in the suspension (except for near zero concentration). Such hysteresis of the flow onset/blockage has also been predicted in the frame of the proposed two-phase flow model, which has been used to calculate steady-state concentration profiles and discharge characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {This dissertation presents stabilized mixed finite element formulations for non-Newtonian models for complex fluids. One class of non-Newtonian fluids is shear-rate dependent fluids that include nonlinear viscosity functions of the second invariant of the rate-of-deformation tensor, thereby resulting in shear-thinning or shear-thickening effects. Another is viscoelastic fluid models that embody elastic stress term as well as viscous stress term, and therefore reveal memory effects via elasticity in the fluid motion. These two model classes can be combined into shear-rate dependent viscoelastic fluid models that are mathematically sophisticated and reflect complicated fluid motions. Since the complexity of the mathematical constructs in non-Newtonian fluid models deteriorates numerical stability of discretized formulations, advanced numerical methods with enhanced stability properties are required for efficient numerical implementations. In this dissertation, the Variational Multiscale VMS) framework is employed to derive stabilized mixed formulations for advection-diffusion, shear-rate dependent, viscoelastic, and shear-rate dependent viscoelastic fluid models. The VMS framework leads to a two-level description of the primary variables, leading to coarse-scale and fine-scale problems. Consistent linearization of the fine-scale problem with respect to the fine-scale fields and the use of bubble functions to expand the fine-scale trial and test functions lead to analytical models for the fine-scale. These nonlinear fine-scale models are variationally embedded in the nonlinear coarse-scale stabilized formulations for the various non-Newtonian fluid models. Advanced computational algorithms that are based on quadratic convergence properties of consistent tangent tensors are derived for efficient nonlinear solution of the system of equations. The new methods are implemented for equal-order linear and quadratic finite elements in two and three-dimensional space triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral elements). The methods are verified via benchmark problems and then extended to human artery models to highlight the significantly distinctive non-Newtonian fluid response in human blood-flow simulations.},

The time evolution of the optical absorbance of the suspensions as a function of oleic acid (OA) concentration, silica nanoparticles concentration and magnetic field strength and direction has been analyzed. Adsorption isotherm demonstrated that OA adsorbs onto iron particles. However, only after the addition of very large amounts of OA (i.e. much more than the amount needed to form a monolayer coating) it is possible to design stable suspensions. The application of an external magnetic field provokes a faster sedimentation due to the formation of field-induced aggregates. When silica nanoparticles are used as stabilizer, a threshold value has been found in the silica concentration. Above this value iron suspensions are stable. The application of a magnetic field decreases this threshold concentration value due to the combined effect of the induced iron chains aggregation and the silica gel network.},

Micromechanical models of formation of magnetic particle chains suggest a complex behavior of magnetorheological (MR) fluids that combines fluid- and solid-like responses. We discuss the hypothesis that, at higher fields, slip occurs between magnetic particle chains and the immersed glass part, while the normal stress is governed by the MRF ribbon elasticity.},

High speed and sport utility vehicles with large joint articulation angles, demand lower Plunging friction inside their CV joints to meet noise and vibration requirements, thus requiring a more thorough understanding of their internal friction characteristics. In this paper, a phenomenological CV joint friction model was developed to model the friction behavior of tripod CV joints by using an instrumented CV joint friction apparatus with tripod-type joint assemblies. Experiments were conduced under different operating conditions of oscillatory speeds, CV joint articulation angles. lubrication, and torque. The experimental data and physical parameters were used to develop a physics-based phenomenological CV joint dynamic friction model. it was found that the proposed friction model captures the experimental data well, and the model Was used to predict the external generated axial force, which is the main source of force that causes vehicle vibration problems.

In this study, the tribological characteristics of sliding surfaces using vane-roller geometry of a rotary compressor were investigated. The sliding tests were carried out under various sliding speeds, normal loads, and surface roughness. During the test, friction force, wear depth, and surface temperature were monitored. Because severe wear occurred on the vane surface, TiN coating was applied on sliding surfaces to prolong the wear life. The sliding tests indicates that there was an optimum initial surface roughness to break in and to prolong the wear life of sliding surfaces. Depending on load and speed, the protective layers, which were composed of metallic oxide and organic compound, were formed on sliding surfaces. Those would play an important role in the amounts of friction and wear between vane and roller surfaces. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The shape of these domains and the mechanism which explains their formation is quite different from what happens in ferrofluids or in ferromagnetic solids where the surface tension associated with the boundaries of the domains plays a major role. The authors report experimental results concerning the size of the domains, the critical field associated with this phase separation and some dynamical aspects of the transition. These experimental results are predicted by a simple model based on the estimation of the magnetic energy in a mean field approximation with the structural unit represented by an ellipsoidal aggregate inside a cylindrical cavity. The similarity with structure formation in electrorheological fluids is qualitatively demonstrated.},

For the purpose of rapid, accurate, and non-destructive measurement of subsurface damage produced in optical grinding and lapping processes, a theoretical model of relationship between subsurface damage and surface roughness was established through investigating median and lateral crack system in brittle surface induced by sharp indenter, and contribution of elastic stress field to the median crack propagation was also considered in the loading cycle. With this model, subsurface damage depth can be predicted accurately via measuring surface roughness of manufactured optical elements. The subsurface damage depth and surface roughness of ground and lapped BK7 glass were measured by MRF (magnetorheological finishing) spot technique and contacting profilometer, respectively, in order to verify the validity of the relationship model. The results show that the relationship model is convenient and accurate in predicting the subsurface damage depth. And there exists monotone increasing non-linear correlation between subsurface damage depth and surface roughness ( p − v value) in optical grinding and lapping processes. At last the relationship between subsurface damage depth and process conditions in grinding and lapping processes and material mechanical properties is discussed.},

  abstract = {Glass is a ubiquitous but essential material in everyday life and industry. The most common method for polishing glass involves the use of free abrasives. However, this method is basically non-deterministic and lacks efficiency. Therefore, vibration has been employed to aid fixed-abrasive polishing in our research. It is found that the vibration can increase the material removal rate while maintain surface quality in fixed abrasive polishing. Normalized Preston coefficients that are the index of the polishing capability of a certain polishing process considerably increase in vibration-assisted polishing process. A mathematic model is set up to interpret the increase in material removal rate for vibration process. The modeled results show that the vibration can improve material removal by increasing vibration amplitude in vertical direction while the horizontal vibration contributes little to increasing material removal rate, which agrees well with experimental results. Aside from material removal, surface morphology of polished glass was also modeled for both vibration and conventional processes. Both experimented and simulated morphology evidence that the vibration some periodic structure on polished surface. The possible mechanism in dry fixed abrasive polishing was also chemically analyzed and a probable mechanism is put forward to clarify the material removal in dry fixed abrasive polishing.},

  abstract = {The depth and morphology of subsurface damage (SSD) in fused silica samples ground with diamond grinding wheels were investigated. The factors possibly influencing the SSD depth of ground samples were examined. The results demonstrate that the SSD depth is most responsive to diamond grit size while the processing parameters (i.e. depth of cut, feed rate, and wheel peripheral speed) have marginal effects on the SSD depth. The SSD depth decreases with the abrasive/grit size of diamond wheels and slightly diminishes with the decrease of cutting depth but little influenced by feeding rate and wheel speed. The morphology inspection shows that the density of subsurface cracks in ground fused silica samples decays exponentially with the depth from the ground surface into the bulk and the cracks vanish at a certain depth that depends on the mechanical and physical properties of samples and diamond abrasives/grits.},

However, it is difficult for the traditional finishing technologies to satisfy both of surface quality and machining efficiency. A hybrid machining method including two or more process makes it possible to solve the problem. This paper presents a compound process (EMAF), which is a combination of electrochemical machining (ECM) and magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF). A novel tool that is capable of adapting to the two processes of different characteristics is designed and a comparative experiment has been made to investigate the effect of EMAF process. The result shows, the EMAF process is able to obtain better surface quality and higher material removal compared with traditional MAF. In operation, the ECM process must cooperate with the MAF process and the ECM must be kept in the passivation status. By means of optimal parameters selected, the surface roughness Ra can down to 0.2 μm from 1.3 μm in a few minutes when the EMAF technology is used to process Al 6061.},

Different wear regions were identified as a function of normal load and speed. The wear surfaces were carefully examined by scanning electron microscopy. The mild and severe wear of 3Y-TZP ceramics are related to plastic deformation and surface fracture, respectively. The mild and severe wear of GCr15 steel is related to plastic deformation and abrasive wear, respectively. At very high normal load and low sliding speed, 3Y-TZP ceramics take negative wear due to steel transfer caused by the strong adherence between 3Y-TZP ceramics and GCr15 steel. The wear mechanisms of 3Y-TZP ceramics and GCr15 steel at different sliding conditions are summarized by their wear mechanism transition diagrams.},

Well-defined dispersions of uniform particles, including spherical silica of varying diameters, hematite of different shapes, and hematite cores coated with silica of different thicknesses, were prepared and used to polish blanket films of Cu and Ta. It was shown that the total surface area of the solids in the slurry controlled the rate of material removal by pure silica for both Cu and Ta, while the surface quality of the polished films was better when higher silica content was used. The shape or the aspect ratio of hematite particles had a minor effect on the removal rate.

The polish rate increased linearly with increasing downward pressure and rotational speed with all of the above slurries. However, the Preston equation does not represent the polish rate data. Inclusion of an additional velocity term, representing the greater dependence of removal rate on the velocity and a constant, representing the purely chemical reactivity of the slurry which is, in general, higher than the static dip rate in the Preston equation, provided a more satisfactory representation of the data. The effect of the concentration of various slurry chemicals on the added constant term was investigated using a bench-top Struers DAP-V polisher. As expected, addition of BTA significantly reduces the Value of this constant. Also some data on polish selectivity and the effect of alumina morphology are presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Fluid-particle interactions are accounted for via Stokes' drag while inter-particle repulsions are modeled through approximate hard-sphere rejections. In accordance with their greater significance, on the other hand (linear) magnetic interactions are fully simulated. The time evolution is considered to be magnetically quasi-static and magnetostatic forces are derived from the solution of (steady) Maxwell's equations, recomputed at each instant in time. For this we use a potential theoretic formulation where the boundary integral equations are solved with a fast multipole approach. We show that the resulting numerical codes can be effectively used to study a number of experimental observables such as effective magnetic permeabilities and response time-scales which are of crucial importance in the design of MR fluids.},

The process of optimization, i.e., the achievement of a global minimum, depends on the rate of reduction of the ac field and on the symmetry of the ac field cycles, The calculations carried out to illustrate these effects include remanence curves and the zero field remanence for both schedules under different conditions. The growth of the magnetization during these processes was studied, and the interaction energy was calculated to best illustrate the optimization.},

  abstract = {A new method of ultra-smooth uniform polishing was presented, which can avoid high-precision surface figure getting worse after ultra-smooth polishing. At first, the fundamental and process were introduced. Then the process was simulated with “Gauss” and “V” type removal function. It shows that there will be no significant influence on optical surface figure after ultra-smooth uniform polishing with any type removal function. To demonstrate the process, a high-precision Ø100 mm fused silica flat optical element was polished, which was prior figured by IBF. Its surface figure accuracy root-mean-square (rms) value is improved from initial 3.624 nm to final 3.393 nm, the mid-spatial frequency surface roughness rms value is improved from initial 0.477 nm to final 0.309 nm, and the high-spatial frequency surface roughness rms value is improved from initial 0.167 nm to final 0.0802 nm. At last, the surface quality of the lens was analyzed by power spectral density (PSD). The result indicates that the surface roughness of high-precision optical element could be improved by ultra-smooth uniform polishing method without the surface figure destroyed.},

  abstract = {Thermal damage is one of the main limitations of the grinding process, so it is important to understand the factors which affect grinding temperatures. This paper presents an overview of analytical methods to calculate grinding temperatures and their effect on thermal damage. The general analytical approach consists of modeling the grinding zone as a heat source which moves along the workpiece surface. A critical factor for calculating grinding temperatures is the energy partition, which is the fraction of the grinding energy transported as heat to the workpiece at the grinding zone. For shallow cut grinding with conventional abrasive wheels, the energy partition is typically 60%–85%. However for creep-feed grinding with slow workspeeds and large depths of cut, the energy partition is only about 5%. Such low energy partitions are attributed to cooling by the fluid at the grinding zone. Heat conduction to the grains can also reduce the energy partition especially with CBN abrasives which have high thermal conductivity. For High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) using CBN wheels with large depths of cut and fast workspeeds, preheated material ahead of the grinding zone is removed together with the chips, thereby lowering the temperature on the finished surface. Analytical models have been developed which take all of these effects into account. Much more research is needed to better understand and quantify how grinding temperatures affect the surface integrity of the finished workpiece.},

The samples with a ferromagnetic particle volume fraction ranging in a large interval 蠁 F e = ( 1 梅 44 ) % were prepared by adding carbonyl iron powder in a highly concentrated transformer oil-based ferrofluid (FF). The ferrofluid has the magnetite volume fraction of 蠁 F e 3 O 4 = 22.90 % and saturation magnetization of M s = 74 k A / m (930 Gs). No further additives were used in order to prevent sedimentation. It was noticed an increase of the static yield stress, of about 3 orders of magnitude, with the increase of the total solid volume fraction of samples and with the increase of the magnetic field, which varied between 0 kA/m and 950 kA/m. The dynamic yield stress (Herschel-Bulkley model) 蟿 H B of the samples strongly increases with the magnetic field and shows a slight tendency of saturation for higher intensities of the magnetic field. There is a less pronounced increase of 蟿 H B , about an order of magnitude with the increasing volume fraction of the iron particles. The relative viscosity increase induced by the magnetic field reaches a maximum for both considered shear rates: 纬 鈰� = 7.85 s - 1 and 纬 鈰� = 88.41 s - 1 and it was revealed an optimal volume fraction of Fe particles, 蠁 F e = 20 % , corresponding to a total volume fraction of 蠁 t o t 鈮� 38 % , at which the magnetoviscous effect has its maximum value. The magnetic properties and also the magnetorheological and the magnetoviscous behavior of highly concentrated ferrofluid-based CMFs can be controlled by the addition of iron microparticles in order to attain the optimal concentration for the envisaged engineering applications, rotating seals and magnetorheological vibration dampers.},

These materials typically consist of micron-sized ferrous particles dispersed in a fluid or an elastomer. A quasi-static, one-dimensional model is developed that examines the mechanical and magnetic properties of magnetorheological materials. This model attempts to account for magnetic non-linearities and saturation by establishing a mechanism by which magnetic flux density is distributed within the composite material. Experimental evidence of the viscoelastic behaviour and magnetic properties of magnetorheological fluids and elastomers suggests that the assumptions made in the model development are reasonable. It is shown that the model is semi-empirical in that it must be fit to the experimental data by adjusting a parameter that accounts for unmodelled magnetic interactions.},

In order to simplify calculations a system is chosen where the magnetic field is sufficiently large that thermal fluctuations of the magnetisation of the individual particles can be ignored. The MC calculations were performed using standard techniques for a three dimensional model of a ferrofluid where the particles are assumed to interact via a spherical hard core plus a short range interaction due to the entropic repulsive forces provided by the surfactant molecules and a long range potential assumed to be produced by a point dipole embedded in the particle centres. The results are compared with those obtained using the hypernetted chain approximation by expanding the pair correlation function in terms of Legendre polynomials with respect to angle to the external field. Very good agreement is found between the two methods enabling accurate and smooth correlation functions to be obtained for large external fields at densities typical of ferrofluids.},

This paper investigates the dependence of brush deburring rate, surface roughness and change in foil thickness on spindle speed and brush nominal penetration during brush deburring of 25 μm thick Nitinol (NiTi) foils. Analysis of the surface after brushing shows that both ploughing and chip formation occur in the process. It is also seen that at bristle tip velocities of about 7 m/s the penetration of abrasives into the foil is dominated by initial contact forces while at about 2 m/s it is dominated by bristle stiffness. Long, slender burrs are removed by fatigue fracture under cyclic loading of the bristles. Burr roots are removed in small chunks as cracks formed by abrasive indentation propagate under cyclic loading of the bristles. A model based on Hertzian contact mechanics is proposed to predict the rate of indentation during brushing and is validated using experiments. The surface roughness initially reduces but subsequently increases with further brushing. Change in foil thickness in all cases is ≤1 μm. A fracture mechanics model for predicting the deburring rate is also proposed and validated.},

  abstract = {Magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) is a process in which the work surface is finished by removing the material in the form of micro chips by magnetic abrasive particles (MAPs) in the presence of magnetic field in the finishing zone. During the MAF process, the frictional heat is generated at the workpiece surface due to the rubbing action of magnetic abrasive particles with the work surface. The order of temperature rise is important to study, as finishing mechanism and surface integrity of work materials depend upon it. The measurement of temperature distribution during MAF operation at the interface of work piece and flexible magnetic abrasive brush (FMAB) interface is difficult. In the present analysis, finite element based ANSYS software has been used to model and simulate magnetic field distribution, magnetic pressure and temperature distribution at work-brush interface during the process. In this work the maximum magnetic flux density has been simulated of the order of 0.223 T at 0.91 A of current in electromagnet coil. Magnetic pressure on MAPs due to magnetic field of electromagnetic coil has been calculated to evaluate the frictional heat flux generated at the work-brush interface. Transient thermal analysis of workpiece domain has been performed to predict the temperature rise due to frictional heat flux. The predicted temperature on work-brush interface was found in the range of 34–51 °C. The developed simulation results based on FEA have been validated with experimental findings.},

The surface integrity after machining hardened steel is superior and more consistent than ground and superfinished surfaces [C.R. Liu, S. Mittal, J. MFg. Syst. 14 (2) (1995) 129–133]. It is also known that hard turning produces compressive residual stresses [C.R. Liu, S. Mittal, Robotics Comput. Integr. Manuf. 12 (1) (1996) 15–27] and that machining parameter such as speed, feed and depth of cut effect the residual stress distribution. It is proposed that the residual stress profile is a deterministic function of the machining parameters. It is postulated that the residual stress profile along the depth is a polynomial function of the depth and the coefficients of this polynomial are in turn functions of the machining parameters. The model, with some refinements, has been developed in this paper and has been checked for accuracy.},

  abstract  = {We developed a computer model to understand the nonequilibrium structures induced in a magnetorheological (MR) fluid by rapidly applying an external magnetic field. MR fluids consist of particles suspended in a liquid where particles interact through dipole moments induced by the external magnetic field. We have simulated these induced structures in both directions, parallel and perpendicular to the field, in the limit of fastest response, by neglecting thermal motion and applying the field instantaneously. Our results show that the process of structure formation starts with particles forming chains aligned with the external field. The chains then coalesce to form columns and wall-like structures (worms as viewed from the top). The complexity of this pattern is found to depend on the concentration of particles and the confinement of the cell in the direction of the external field. These results are consistent with experimental observations [G.A. Flores et al., in Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on ER Fluids, MR Suspensions, and Associated Technology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, July 1995, edited by W. Bullough (World Scientific, Singapore, 1996), p. 140]. We have also used this model to study the interaction of two chains.

The results showed that the highest values of the compression and tension strengths of fluids correspond to the larger particle sizes (550 nm) with 1.241 and 0.594 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the compression and tension strengths of the mixed one (1.153 and 0.388 MPa) containing 60 and 300 nm samples are higher than its components with 0.431 and 0.249 MPa, as well as 0.694 and 0.367 MPa, respectively.},

A magnetic abrasive brush was formed between a magnetic pole and a workpiece material, in which the summation of three kinds of energy necessary for magnetization of abrasives, i.e. repulsion between bundles (Faraday effect) and line tension of outer curved bundle was considered to be minimum. A normal force that pushes the abrasives on the brush end to be indented into the material surface is generated by the magnetic field. The magnetic abrasive brush will then be an extension of the magnetic pole. In this process, the tangential force acts to be the returning force created when the abrasive deviates from the magnetic balance point. Thus, the magnetic abrasives are expected to polish the material surface softly.},

  abstract = {An efficient finite element procedure has been developed to calculate the temperatures and stresses arising due to a moving source of heat. The procedure is applied to calculate the thermal stresses produced in hardened steels during grinding. The thermal load during grinding is modeled as a uniformly or triangularly distributed, 2D heat source moving across the surface of a half-space, which is insulated or subjected to convective cooling. The grinding of elastic and elastic–plastic workpiece materials has been simulated. The calculated transient stresses and temperatures in an elastic solid are found to be in good agreement with prior analytical and numerical results. In an elastic–plastic workpiece material, for which no analytical solution is available for the residual stress distributions, the finite element calculations show that the near surface residual stress is predominantly tensile and that the magnitude of this stress increases with increasing heat flux values. Based on an analysis of the effects of workpiece velocity, heat flux magnitude and convective cooling, on the residual stress distributions in an elastic–plastic solid, it is seen that the calculated thermal stress distributions are consistent with experimentally measured residual stresses on ground surfaces. Furthermore, the results explain often cited observations pertaining to thermally induced grinding stresses in metals.},

  abstract = {Magnetorheological (MR) fluid is a suspension of small iron particles, where, in the presence of a magnetic field, the solid particles arranged themselves as deformable chains. The deformation of the chain structure can be performed in three common modes known as flow mode, shear mode and squeeze mode. Among the three, the flow and shear modes have been widely investigated and used in commercial applications. Nevertheless, limited focus has been given to the combination of both modes. Furthermore, the existing combination between the flow and shear mode has been always defined at the same effective area, which is commonly known as the shear-flow mode. This paper provides a new perspective of mixed mode by arranging in series the different modes in the same MR cell. In order to manifest the theoretical model, an effective area representing the shear-flow mode is positioned separately with another effective area of the pure flow mode. The magnetic circuit design is validated by using the finite element method in 2D simulation. Moreover, the simulated results of magnetic flux density in the MR fluid are used to predict the force produced by the flow and shear-flow modes. The fabricated cell is tested under quasi-static loading and the results are compared with those that were predicted. It can be concluded that, to a certain extent, the obtained experimental results have been successfully predicted by the proposed model.},

To understand the mechanisms, a temperature-dependent finite element heat transfer model incorporating a triangular moving heat source was developed to describe the temperature field, thus to predict the thickness of the grinding-hardened layer. The analysis carried out included the variation effect of depth of cut caused by the change in wheel–workpiece engagement. The model was applied on quenchable steel 1045 and the analysis was verified experimentally. It was shown that the heating cycle in plunge cylindrical grinding is the result of consecutive heating and cooling processes, varying from location to location in a workpiece. The ratio of the workpiece speed to the infeed rate plays an important role in the heat treatment cycle.},

Magnetorheological behaviours of bidisperse MR polishing fluid for comparison with monodisperse MR polishing fluid using physica MCR-301 rheometer is presented in this paper. The flow behaviour of MRP fluid has been evaluated by steady state rheograms at different magnetic field strength. The yield shear stress and viscosity of bidisperse MRP fluid for all experiments were found maximum at 16 vol% CIPs CS grade, 4 vol% CIPs HS grade, 25 vol% abrasives and 55 vol% base fluid. The results indicate that the yield shear stress and viscosity of bidisperse MRP fluid has been found improved as compare to monodisperse MRP fluid for all magnetic field strength. The morphology of the prepared samples has been studied using scanning electron microscope. After characterization, the experiment was performed with bidisperse MRP fluid on mild steel work-piece using ball end MR finishing tool for 30 minutes with a set of given machining parameters. Percentage reduction in surface roughness (%ΔRa) was calculated and found superior results as compared to existing one.},

For these applications the knowledge of the suspensions' thermophysical properties is of major interest to guarantee a safe and effective application. Therefore the flow behavior cannot be neglected as it might significantly influence the execution of the aforementioned applications. In this experimental study two biocompatible ferrofluids were investigated. Rheological measurements were carried out using rotational rheometry. To allow an interpretation of the fluids' behavior the microscopic make-up was investigated using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Measurements of diluted ferrofluids were carried out as a first step to simulate the rheological behavior reflecting the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles found in blood flow for most biomedical applications of such fluids. The detected strong effects show the potential to significantly influence application and handling of the biocompatible ferrofluids in the medical area and should therefore be taken into account for further research as well as for the application of such fluids.},

The viscometer was non-destructive to the RTIL and the viscosity measurements were made under typical levels of O2 and H2O of less than 1 ppm. The viscometer was calibrated with Milli-Q water and sucrose solutions (20, 40 and 60% w/w) at 14 temperatures (10 °C ⩽T⩽ 70 °C). Three balls of diameters 3.2, 4 and 5 mm were used for the calibration. We found that the ball with the smallest diameter (3.2 mm) was more accurate for measuring the viscosities. The activation energies for viscous flow (Eη) for each RTIL were calculated, from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots. Eη was correlated with changes in molecular structure of the RTIL; those containing high molar mass and less symmetric cations had higher Eη values. The Arrhenius plot was not linear for the majority of the RTILs and some of these RTILs were better fitted with the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) equation. Those RTILs which obeyed the Arrhenius law typically contained asymmetric cations and the majority did not contain functional groups. Those RTILs which obeyed the VTF law contained small and symmetrical cations with low molar mass. Those RTILs which obeyed neither the Arrhenius nor the VTF law consisted of cations which were less symmetric, contained functional groups (e.g., OH and CO) and had higher molar mass. The glass transition temperatures To (calculated from the VTF fittings) generally decreased with increasing size and molar mass of the cation and anion. The chloroaluminate RTILs containing oxygenated cations were more volatile than the corresponding de-oxygenated RTILs making them unsuitable for applications as solvents and/or electrolytes above ambient temperature.},

  abstract = {Magneto-rheological fluid (MRF) technology is an old "newcomers" coming to the market at high speed. Various industries including the automotive industry are full of potential MRF applications. Magneto-rheological fluid technology has been successfully employed already in various low and high volume applications. A structure based on MRF might be the next generation in design for products where power density, accuracy and dynamic performance are the key features. Additionally, for products where is a need to control fluid motion by varying the viscosity, a structure based on MRF might be an improvement in functionality and costs. Two aspects of this technology, direct shear mode (used in brakes and clutches) and valve mode (used in dampers) have been studied thoroughly and several applications are already present on the market. Excellent features like fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and mechanical power output, and precise controllability make MRF technology attractive for many applications. This paper presents the state of the art of an actuator with a control arrangement based on MRF technology. The study shows that excellent features like fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and the mechanical power output, and controllability make MRF the next technology of choice for many applications.

The MR fluid obeys the Herschel–Bulkley constitutive relation with a magnetic field dependent on yield stress. While the eccentric ratio or the gap between two cylinders is very small, local flow can be assumed between two parallel plates. With this simplification of motion equation, the effects of the magnetic field, eccentricity ratio and power-law exponent (n=0.25, 0.5 and 1) on the tangential velocity, torque and pressure gradient are analyzed analytically. Then, the results were compared with two-dimensional (2D) simulations for a system of two eccentric cylinders filled with a MR fluid. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation results show good agreement with analytical solution. A wider range of the various parameters has been studied by the 2-D simulations. The influences of MR effects on flow field are significant and not negligible. The viscosity increases by increasing the magnetic field and eccentricity ratio, consequently providing an enhancement in the yield stresses and total torque required to rotate the inner cylinder.},

The effects of magnetic field and weight percentage of particles on the viscosity of the MR fluid have been measured using a rotational viscometer. The yield stress under an applied magnetic field was also obtained experimentally. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the MR fluid behaves as a Newtonian fluid. When the magnetic field is applied, the MR fluid behaves like Bingham plastics with a magnetic field dependent yield stress. Afterward, the results compared with those of CFD simulation of two eccentric cylinders in the MR fluid. Results show that the influences of MR effects, caused by the applied magnetic field, on the model characteristics are significant and not negligible. The viscosity is enhanced by increasing of the magnetic field, eccentricity ratio and weight percentage of suspensions. The MR effects and increasing of weight percentage and eccentricity ratio also provide an enhancement in the yield stresses and required total torque for rotation of inner cylinder. Also the simulation results indicate a good representation of the experiment by the model.},

Rheology results indicated that single mineral experiments showed that 5 and 10 vol.% of quartz and hematite had no shear yield stress whereas the one of nickel oxide was positive value. Shear yield stress of nickel oxide–quartz mixture and nickel oxide–hematite mixtures increased as increasing pH and solid concentration, and the value was higher than the one obtained with only nickel oxide.

  abstract = {As one of the most important field-responsive intelligent and smart soft matter materials, magnetorheological (MR) fluids, consisting of magneto-responsive magnetizable particles suspended in non-magnetic fluids, have drawn a lot of attentions in both academia and industry as their physical and rheological characteristics can be controlled with external magnetic field strength. In this highlight, preparation methods and MR properties of various magnetic composites with soft magnetic particles and polymers are reviewed. In addition, some industrial applications, such as a MR dampers and a MR polishing, are briefly summarized.},

Magnetic property and morphology of the nanoparticle were confirmed via vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. MR fluids, consisting of micron-sized CI and carrier fluid, were investigated under different external magnetic field strengths via a rotational rheometer. Their flow behaviors at a steady shear mode were examined with and without a nano-sized magnetic additive under magnetic field strength. The MR fluid with magnetic CI nanoparticle added demonstrated slightly higher yield behaviors, suggesting that micron-sized CI and magnetic CI nanoparticle particle were being oriented in magnetic field direction under applied magnetic field and with strengthened structure.},

  abstract = {The rheological properties and dispersion stability of magnetorheological (MR) fluids consisting of hydrophilic treated carbonyl iron particles dispersed in a water-in-oil emulsion were studied for the first time by the use of a stress-controlled rheometer and sedimentation test. In order to improve the stability of the MR fluids, carbonyl iron magnetic particles were chemisorbed by Tween 80 and a water-in-oil emulsion was employed as a continuous phase for MR fluids. Attraction between hydrophilic-treated carbonyl iron and water emulsion in continuous phase plays a critical role in greatly improving stability of dense carbonyl iron particles against sedimentation without restricting rheological properties. On application of magnetic fields, the suspensions show a striking increase in viscosity. Since constant stress is generated within the limit of zero shear rate, the plateau in the flow curve corresponds to the Bingham yield stress. Under a low external magnetic field, the yield stress varied as B3/2, indicating that local magnetization saturation occurs between the neighboring magnetized particles. The yield stress has an approximately linear relation to the particle volume fraction.},

  abstract = {Mechanism of structure formation in bidispersed colloids is important for its physical and optical properties. It is microscopically observed that the mechanism of chain formation in magnetic nanofluid based magnetorheological (MR) fluid is quite different from that in the conventional MR fluid. Under the application of magnetic field the magnetic nanoparticles are filled inside the structural microcavities formed due to the association of large magnetic particles, and some of the magnetic nanoparticles are attached at the end of the chains formed by the large particles. The dipolar energy of the large particles in a magnetic nanofluid matrix becomes effective magnetic permeability (μeff) times smaller than that of the neutral medium. Inclusion of magnetic nanoparticles (∼10 nm) with large magnetic particles (∼3–5 μm) restricts the aggregation of large particles, which causes the field induced phase separation in MR fluids. Hence, nanofluid based MR fluids are more stable than conventional MR fluids, which subsequently increase their application potentiality.},

  abstract = {In the present paper a new grinding force model is developed by incorporating the effects of variable coefficient of friction and ploughing force. This is based on the fact that chip formation during grinding consists of three stages: ploughing, cutting and rubbing. Equations for the total normal and tangential force components per unit width of the grinding, during these three stages, were established. These components were expressed in terms of the experimental coefficients and process parameters like wheel speed, table feed and depth of cut. All the coefficients were determined experimentally by performing grinding tests at specified conditions. The variation of the friction coefficient with process parameters such as wheel speed and work feed has been taken into consideration while calculating the frictional force components. The ploughing force components were modelled by performing single-grit tests. During these tests the grinding forces were measured by duplicating the cutting mechanism of grinding wheel using a dummy aluminium wheel and a diamond indenter. The predicted normal and tangential grinding forces were compared with those experimentally obtained and the results show reasonable agreement quantitatively. From the total force values the contributions of each component of force were obtained.},

  abstract  = {A micro–macro model is formulated for the magnetomechanical behavior of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) based on micromechanics and a statistical approach. It includes two stages: (1) the analysis of the aggregation of the particles in an MRF into chains of dipoles aligning in the direction of the applied magnetic field and its contribution to resistance against shear deformation, and (2) the attainment of solid-like mechanical properties of the MRF by assuming numerous chains inclining with the angles arranged in a normal distribution. This model takes into account the effect of each of the main influencing factors, such as the intensity of magnetic induction, the size and the volume fraction of particles, shear strain rate and saturation magnetization, etc, on the critical shear stress of MRFs. The effect of typical governing parameters on the behavior of MRFs is investigated individually, which shows the capability of the proposed model in the description of the magnetorheological behavior of MRFs. The common Bingham's model of viscoplasticity and the dual-viscosity model can be obtained from the proposed model as special cases. The model is comprehensive, simple, and can easily be used for the initial design and optimization of high-performance MRFs.},

It has already been shown that ferrofluids with low Curie temperature are able to create a liquid flow without any mechanical part. In fact a pressure gradient can be obtained when subjecting this ferrofluids to both a temperature gradient and a magnetic field. In this paper a novel experimental setup is proposed. It is thermally and magnetically instrumented to achieve a precise analysis of the local behavior of the ferrofluids. A MnZn based ferrofluid was investigated on steady and transient states. The results confirm that a hydrostatic pressure can be successfully created. The behavior of the ferrofluid is analyzed considering a homogeneous applied magnetic field or not. A pressure drop is also highlighted and discussed in terms of temperature gradient evolution and magneto-convection in the ferrofluid.},

  Abstract                 = {The fast multipole method (FMM) is a technique allowing the fast calculation of long-range interactions between N points in O ( N ) or O ( N ln N ) steps with some prescribed error tolerance. The FMM has found many applications in the field of integral equations and boundary element methods, in particular by accelerating the solution of dense linear systems arising from such formulations. Original FMMs required analytical expansions of the kernel, for example using spherical harmonics or Taylor expansions. In recent years, the range of applicability and the ease of use of FMMs has been extended by the introduction of black box [1] or kernel independent techniques [2]. In these approaches, the user only provides a subroutine to numerically calculate the interaction kernel. This allows changing the definition of the kernel with minimal change to the computer program. In this talk we will present a novel kernel independent FMM, which leads to diagonal multipole-to-local operators. This results in a significant reduction in the computational cost [1], in particular when high accuracy is needed. The approach is based on Cauchy's integral formula and the Laplace transform. We will present a numerical analysis of the convergence, methods to choose the parameters in the FMM given some tolerance, and the steps required to build a multilevel scheme from the single level formulation. Numerical results are given for benchmark calculations to demonstrate the accuracy as a function of the number of multipole coefficients, and the computational cost of the different steps in the method.},

This research illustrates the successful implementation of a neural network to accomplish such a simulation. The characteristic of this neural network is described along with the decision of the used inputs and outputs.

Two types of systems are considered: magnetic fluids and solidified ferrocolloids containing randomly spatially distributed particles with negligible energy of magnetic anisotropy. The results of numerical simulations confirm the universality of Langevin susceptibility as a main dimensionless parameter determining the influence of interparticle interactions on the magnetization of the system for moderate values of the aggregation parameter. The obtained results are in good agreement with theoretical and experimental data. At large values of the aggregation parameter, the clustering of particles in magnetic fluids is observed resulting in a reduction of their magnetization as compared to solidified systems. It is shown that the magnetization of solidified systems can be well described by the modified effective field approximation within the whole investigated range of parameters.},

In the case of magnetite ferrocolloids a 螕-distribution has been found to provide higher accuracy in calculation of the sixth-order moments (in comparison with the commonly used lognormal distribution), i.e. in calculation of the initial susceptibility, analysis of the Rayleigh scattering and aggregation processes. Among the well-known theoretical models developed to describe ferrocolloid magnetization analytically taking into account the interparticle interactions, the mean-spherical model gives the most stable results. A modified variant of the effective field model has been proposed which is nearly the same in accuracy as the mean-spherical model but more compact and suitable for application.},

All the emulsions show a similar elastic response with a modulus plateau at low frequency and a small phase angle (&lt;15°) in dynamic oscillatory shear, and shear-thinning behavior in steady shear measurements. This is independent of ϕo, oil polarity and ψ. The dynamic modulus (G′) and complex viscosity (η*) increase with an increase in ϕo and oil polarity, due to enhanced droplet packing and flocculation and particle aggregation on droplet surfaces. The presence of a magnetic field promotes particle attractions and associations and enhances the strength of the three-dimensional particle and droplet networks, thus remarkably increasing G′ and η* and raising the yield stress. The increase in modulus, viscosity and yield stress are beneficial for the elevation of the stability of these functional emulsions.},

The nature of interparticle forces determines the colloidal structure (crystalline order due to long range repulsive forces, flocculation due to attractive forces, etc.) and hence, the flow behavior of suspensions. The aim of this article is to discuss how these interactions enter the modeling of rheometric functions, in particular, the shear viscosity. In this sense, the main interactions commonly appearing in colloids are reviewed, as well as the role they play in phase transition behavior. Then, a series of approaches relating the interaction potential to viscosity is examined. The results of applying these models to experimental data are also discussed. Finally, examples of viscosity modeling for different interaction potentials are given, by using the structural model proposed previously by the authors. The possibility of relating the flow behavior of colloidal suspensions to the interaction between particles offers new perspectives for the study and technical applications of these systems.},

  abstract = {In recent years, aluminum alloy based metal matrix composites (MMC) are gaining wide spread acceptance in several interesting applications such as piston, connecting rod, microwave filters, vibrator component, contactors, impellers and space structures. These composites possess excellent wear resistance in addition to other superior mechanical properties such as strength, modulus and hardness when compared with conventional alloys. Of all the aluminum alloys, 6061 is quite popular choice as a matrix material to prepare MMCs owing to its better formability characteristics and option of modification of the strength of composites by adopting optimal heat treatment. From the literature, it is quite evident that the focus has been centered on processing of MMCs and characterization of mechanical properties of MMCs. Tribological characteristics of several MMC systems involving glass, flyash, SiC, Al2O3 as discontinuous dispersoids have been reported. However, meagre data are available as regards the theoretical prediction of wear rate of MMCs. Prediction of wear rate gains impetus in present industrial scenario to assess the life of sliding components in advance to avoid huge economic losses that incur due to wear. In the light of the above, the present investigation deals with preparation of A16061-TiO2 composites by liquid metallurgy route. The extent of incorporation of TiO2 in the composite was varied from 2 to 10 wt\%. Microstructure studies, hardness and wear test were conducted on the cast A16061-TiO2 composites. Pin on disc machine was used to assess the wear resistance of the prepared composites. Load was varied from 10 to 40 N while the sliding distance was from 90 to 540 m. Wear coefficients were evaluated by using Archard's and Yang's theoretical models. Increased contents of TiO2 resulted in higher hardness and lower wear coefficient of the composites under identical test conditions. The wear coefficient of all the A16061-TiO2 Composites studied decreased at higher loads and larger sliding distances. The predicted values of the wear coefficient are in close agreement with the experimental ones. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The field-induced suspension yield stress increased sub-quadratically with the flux density. The small amplitude oscillatory shear response exhibited history dependence.

The equipment constant of the rheometer was obtained using liquids with predetermined viscosities. Experimentally measured viscosities were used to evaluate different equations for suspension viscosities. Deviation of measured suspension viscosities from the Einstein equation was found to be basically due to the influence of spatial distribution and aggregation of Fe3O4 MNPs. By taking account of the coating layer on MNPs and the aggregation of MNPs in MFs, a modified Einstein equation was proposed to fit the experimental data. Moreover, the influence of external magnetic field on viscosity was also taken into account. Viscosities thus predicted are in good agreement with experimental data. Temperature effect on suspension viscosity was shown experimentally to be due to the shear-thinning behavior of the MFs.},

While the operators themselves have a fairly complicated structure (described somewhat incompletely by the classical addition theorems for the Bessel functions), their diagonal forms turn out to be quite simple. These diagonal forms are realized as generalized integrals, possess straightforward physical interpretations, and admit stable numerical implementation. This paper uses the obtained analytical apparatus to construct an algorithm for the rapid application to arbitrary vectors of matrices resulting from the discretization of integral equations of the potential theory for the Helmholtz equation in three dimensions. It is an extension to the three-dimensional case of the results of Rokhlin (J. Complexity4(1988), 12-32), where a similar apparatus is developed in the two-dimensional case.},

For ferrous materials, significant damage occurs above a maximum workpiece background temperature of 475°C. It is also known that the energy entering the workpiece is reduced due to conduction into the grinding wheel. It has been found that the partitioning of energy between the grinding wheel and the workpiece remains approximately constant. However, the overall partition ratio to the workpiece, which takes account of energy transfer to the chips as well as energy transfer to the wheel, is variable. The effective thermal properties of the grinding wheel may be established by correlating theory with grinding experiments. An effective coefficient for the temperature equation can be obtained corresponding to the use of the geometric contact length in the equation. Using these conclusions, a simplified approach has been developed for control of thermal damage.},

Effect of magnetic field has been investigated on specimens mounted in a holder and subjected to MRAH. It is observed that the change in the surface finish on magnetic specimens is insignificant, while the surface finish on non-magnetic specimens improves appreciably. By a novel method of introducing magnetic specimens along with non-magnetic specimens, the magnetic field near the non-magnetic specimens is enhanced. The results obtained on the non-magnetic specimens by this approach for different magnetic field and process duration confirm that the finishing capability of the process is greatly improved, and yields a maximum improvement in finish of 41.7% and 43.5%, respectively while the previously reported results are 6.7% and 24.2%.},

This paper outlines the design and development of magnetorheological abrasive honing setup. A DC electromagnet with cylindrical pole faces is used and measurement for magnetic flux density is done. Experiments are conducted with aluminum and austenitic stainless steel workpieces to understand the effect of magnetic field. Effect of initial roughness, workpiece rotation and process duration on finishing was investigated with ground austenitic stainless steel workpieces. It is observed that the improvement in finish is better for rougher surface and higher rotation speed of workpiece and a reduction in roughness is consistent with process duration.},

  abstract = {The state of a surface region after machining is definitely affected by cutting parameters, such as cutting speed, feed rate, tool nose radius, tool rake angle and the presence of a cutting fluid, which plays a major role in determining friction at the tool–chip interface. The aim of the present study is to develop a finite element model based on the general-purpose nonlinear finite element code MSC.Marc by MSC.Software Corporation. This software is capable of simulating the cutting process of low-pressure turbine disks of aircraft jet engines from its very beginning to steady-state conditions. Basically, the present analysis is a coupled thermo-mechanical dynamic-transient problem, based on the update Lagrangian formulation; no pre-defined path is given for the separation of the chip from the workpiece, since material deformation occurs as a continuous indentation performed by the rigid tool. In addition to the cutting parameters, the main inputs in this analysis are material constitutive data, the friction coefficient at the toolchip interface and the cutting tool temperature. All the relevant variables, like stresses, strains, temperatures, chip shape and residual stresses, are predicted in a wide range of cutting conditions. The results from the model are compared to some basic theories of metal cutting and to an experimental study, concerning orthogonal cutting of steel AISI 316L. Concerning the specific case of turning process of nickel alloy Inconel 718 low-pressure turbine disks, the calculated residual stress are compared to experimental measurements from real machined disks.},

  abstract = {Grind hardening process utilizes the heat generated in the grinding area for the surface heat treatment of the workpiece. The workpiece surface is heated above the austenitizing temperature by using large values of depth of cut and low workpiece feed speeds. The workpiece undergoes martensitic phase transformation increasing its hardness in the surface layer. Usually compressive residual stresses are induced in the surface layer. In the present paper, modeling and prediction of the residual stresses profile as a function of the process parameters is presented. The model's results are validated for two cases; a dry grind hardening and a coolant assisted grind hardening of AISI 1045 steel.},

  abstract = {The cutting process of the affected layer is simulated by FEM and the influence of cutting sequence on residual stress and strain are discussed in this report. The residual stress and strain after machining in the workpiece are affected by the flow stress characteristic of the workpiece and the cutting conditions, like tool geometry and cutting speed. In addition, the affected layer by previous cutting is usually cut again in the following cutting process. Cutting of the affected layer causes the change of cutting forces or shear angle. Thus the residual stress and strain are affected by the cutting sequence, too. In the cutting sequence from roughing to finishing, the residual stress might be changed by each cutting sequence. In case of the rough machining of an annealed workpiece, the tensile residual stress is generated in the cutting direction within the machined surface. The fine machining following the rough machining causes the compressive residual stress on the surface. Repetition of the fine machining, however, does not cause the compressive residual stress any more. According to these results the residual stress level might be controlled by the optimization of machining process.},

In this work, a model based on Reye's wear hypothesis is proposed for the assessment Of Surface roughness prediction as a function of operating parameters, in the deterministic polishing process of glass moulds. According to Reye's hypothesis, the removed material per unit area is proportional to the work due to the friction force: the removed material per unit area can be computed by adequately integrating the area[ material ratio function (Abbott-Firestone curve) of the surface and can be associated with the amplitude roughness parameter: the work due to the friction force per unit area is proportional to the integral of the product of pressure and velocity in the time interval and can be derived from the process parameters by means of the Hertz theory. The model assessment was performed on ground glass flat samples polished with different operating parameters, mapping the surface roughness using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The developed model shows a satisfactory estimate of surface roughness evolution during the polishing process and confirms the experimental results found in the literature for the Preston coefficient.

  abstract = {Computer controlled polishing (CCP) is widely used in the production of high-quality optical lenses. CCP enables surface error-profile-dependent calculation of polishing sequences prior to processing, and facilitates the cost-effective manufacture of high-quality optical surfaces. Calculation of an individual polishing sequence requires knowledge of the surface error-profile in addition to knowledge of the material removal characteristic (influence function) of the polishing tool. Measurement errors during both determination of the surface error-profile, and the influence function, may lead to an incorrect polishing sequence calculation, which in turn may result in an inadequate product quality. A new method has been developed which minimises the effects of measurement errors on the influence function. The resulting algorithm renders an influence function symmetrical and filters noisy data. Practical polishing tests with magnetorheological finishing have been performed to verify this new technique. The improvement of the peak-valley (PV) value of the surfaces polished with the symmetrical rendered influence function was observed to average 14% greater than that which related to the PV value improvement of those surfaces which were polished with the unmodified influence function. The algorithm developed is based on software and is easily implemented. Thus, artificial enhancement of an influence function is a straightforward technique to improve the result of the polishing process.},

  abstract = {In the computer controlled polishing, a polishing tool moves in a well-defined manner across the workpiece surface in order to individually remove the surface error-profile. The commonly used technique to calculate the moving of the polishing tool is the dwell time method. Based on a constant (time-invariant) removal characteristic of the polishing tool (influence function) the amount of material to be removed is controlled via the dwell time. The longer the polishing tool is in contact with a particular area of the workpiece, the more material is removed at this position. Mathematical basics to calculate dwell time-profiles are shown, and a new approach considering time-variant influence functions for the computer controlled polishing is introduced. The results point out that time-variant influence functions may contribute to further decrease the process time, and thus to make a computer controlled polishing process more efficient. The reduction of the process time was observed to approximately 35% using a combination of the dwell time method with time-variant influence functions.},

However, the effects of the process-induced residual stress profile and the white layer on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) are poorly understood. This study aims to answer the long-standing question of how residual stress and the white layer affect RCF. Based on the developed real-time RCF testing system, a series of RCF tests were conducted for hard turned AISI 52100 steel components. The test results have shown that the acoustic emission amplitude is most consistent and sensitive to fatigue damage than other AE parameters. A white layer induced by hard turning is very detrimental to RCF. A component free of a white layer can have a life six times that of a white layer component. As the white layer increases in thickness, the fatigue life decreases. Surface residual stresses and near-surface residual stress profiles are significant factors for RCF, while the depth of maximum compressive residual stress in subsurface is not critical. Surface integrity affects RCF through the mechanism of near surface damage rather than subsurface damage.},

Suitable process parameters will produce certain favorable surface integrity or at least avoid detrimental phase transformations to component performance.

This research is to study the feasibility of obtaining four distinct types of surface integrity, which may have potential dramatic effects on fatigue life of hard-machined components. This study identifies surface integrity first and follows with the necessary conditions possible to create it in hard turning. Favorable surface integrity for optimal fatigue life can be produced using small feeds and sharp cutting tools. From the process point of view, tool wear is the dominant factor to promote white layer formation and yields a large variance of surface roughness, which may significantly deteriorate component life. A white layer could be more than 30% harder and a dark layer about 60% softer than the bulk material.},

  abstract = {A fabrication method of curved surfaces on silicon-based micro-structures using magneto theological finishing is studied. Thorough explanations are made on the procedures for the evaluation and analysis of surface characteristics of a workpiece and on the fabrication method of the curved surface profile associated with the experiments using magnetorheological finishing. The effect of magnetic field around tool assembly on finished surface profiles is investigated using a finite element method (FEM). The analysis on the magnetic field is performed separately from that of the fluid flow field with the assumption that the field is weakly coupled to the working fluid at steady state with a certain geometric configuration adopted in this work. Several experiments were performed under controlled conditions and the results are demonstrated along with the physical interpretations thereof. The edge effect is turned out to be very important as the target workpiece gets smaller, which can be actively used for the fabrication of curved surfaces on millimeter-scale structures. Response surface methodology (RSM) is applied to predict the profile and roughness of the curved surface of the workpiece to be proceeded with a set of known experimental conditions. In order to use the RSM method, two control input and two response variables are chosen deliberately. Among the multi-regression models generally used in the modeling area, a second-order regression model is employed. The predicted results are verified through additional experiments performed independently. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The MR fluid under investigation contains about 85 wt% of micro-sized carbonyl iron (CI) particles and about 15 wt% of water and surfactant(s) compound. A semi-empirical material removal model is proposed for the description of the tribological behavior of the MR fluid in the finishing process by considering both the solid- and fluid-like characteristics of the fluid in a magnetic field. Additionally, Archard's theory and Amonton's law of friction are applied to the model, which is completed by experimental efforts to identify the relationship between the effective friction coefficient and the ratio of the interfacial particle velocity to the imposed pressure on the workpiece surface. It turns out that the effective friction coefficient has a linear relationship with this ratio. The validity of the proposed model is supported through material removal rate measurements. It is also shown that the proposed model is substantially different from the conventional Preston equation in that the material removal rate is not only a function of the product of the applied normal pressure and relative velocity, but it also strongly depends on the square of the relative velocity.},

  abstract  = {The effects of dispersed phase saturation magnetization and applied magnetic fields on the rheological properties of magnetorheological (MR) fluids are described. MR fluids based on two different grades of carbonyl iron powder with different average particle size, 7鈥�9 渭m (grade A) and 2 渭m (grade B), were prepared. Vibrating sample magnetometer measurements showed that the saturation magnetization values were 2.03 and 1.89 T for grades A and B, respectively. Rheological measurements were conducted for 33 and 40 vol% grade A and grade B based MR fluids with a specially built double Couette strain rate controlled rheometer at flux densities ranging from 0.2 to ~0.8 T. The yield stresses of 33 and 40 vol% grade A were 100 卤 3 and 124 卤 3 kPa, respectively at 0.8 卤 0.1 T. The yield stress values of MR fluids based on finer particles (grade B) were consistently smaller. For example, the yield stresses for 33 and 40 vol% grade B based MR fluid were 80 卤 8 and 102 卤 2 kPa, respectively at 0.8 卤 0.1 T. The yield stresses at the flux density approaching magnetic saturation in particles (B ~ 0.8T) were found to increase quadratically with the saturation magnetization (渭 0 M s ) of the dispersed magnetic phase. This is in good agreement with the analytical models of uniformly saturated particle chains developed by Ginder and co-workers. The results presented here show that the decrease in yield stress for finer particle based MR fluids is due to the relatively smaller magnetization of the finer particles.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fluid has many advantages when serving as lubricant. With an appropriate magnetic field this lubricant can prevent leakage and increase the load capacity of lubricant film. It can also be fixed at the friction zone by applying an external magnetic field. A novel design of magnetic fluid lubrication with magnetic surface texture was proposed in this paper. A micro-scale dimple pattern was firstly fabricated on the surface of tribo-pair and then a permanent magnet material was electrodeposited into these dimples, so that there are both geometric surface texture and periodic distribution of magnetic field on the surface (magnetic surface texture). In this paper, CoNiMnP permanent magnetic film (about 25 mu m thickness) was electrodeposited into micro-dimples (500 mu m in diameter) on the surface of 316 stainless steel. The impact of magnetic surface texture on lubrication was investigated using a pin-on-disk test rig. The test results showed that magnetic surface texture was conducive to form effective lubrication at low sliding velocity when lubricated by magnetic fluids. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Magnetorheological (MR) fluids are described using two nondimensional numbers, the Bingham and Mason numbers. The Mason number is the ratio of particle magnetic forces to viscous forces and describes the behavior of MR fluids at the microscopic, particle level scale. At the macroscopic, continuum scale, Bingham number is the ratio of yield stress to viscous stress, and describes the bulk motion of the fluid. If these two nondimensional numbers can be related, then microscopic models can be directly compared to macroscopic results. We show that if microscopic and macroscopic forces are linearly related, then Bingham and Mason number are inversely related, or, alternatively, that the product of the Bingham number and the Mason number is a constant. This relationship is experimentally validated based on measurements of apparent viscosity on a high shear rate, γ ̇ ≈ 10 000 s - 1 , Searle cell rheometer. This relationship between Mason number and Bingham number is then used to analyze a Mason number based result, and is also used to inform the MR fluid device design process.},

  abstract  = {Magnetorheological finishing MRF) is a relatively new technology used in precision polishing. It utilizes micron-sized magnetic carbonyl iron CI), nonmagnetic polishing abrasives, aqueous or nonaqueous carrier fluids and hydrodynamic flow in a magnetic field to remove material from a part surface. The versatility of the MR fluid has been exploited in order to study the mechanisms of material removal in the MRF of glass. Macroscopic aspects of MRF are studied. The design and operation of a magnetorheometer is described. This new instrument is shown to be able to accurately measure the dynamic yield stress of an MR fluid in the same field orientation used in polishing. This field orientation is shown to be an important consideration in the determination of the magnitude of the yield stress. This result is used to model the bulk flow of the MR fluid underneath a glass part during polishing, allowing for the calculation of the shear stress at the surface of the glass part using experimentally determined pressure distributions. These shear stress distributions are shown to correlate with removal profiles. Mechanisms on the microscopic scale are also investigated. The nanohardness of the individual particles are characterized with novel nanoindentation techniques. Removal experiments show that the nanohardness of the CI is important in nonaqueous MR fluids with no abrasives, but is relatively unimportant in aqueous MR fluids and/or when nonmagnetic abrasives are present. The hydrated layer created by the chemical effects of water is shown to change the way material is removed by hard CI as the MR fluid transitions from a nonaqueous MR fluid to an aqueous MR fluid. Drag force measurements and atomic force microscope AFM) scans demonstrate that, when added to an MR fluid, nonmagnetic abrasives move to the region between the CI and part surface and become responsible for material removal. Removal rates increase with the addition of these polishing abrasives cerium oxide, aluminum oxide and diamond). The relative increase depends on the amount and type of abrasive used because of differences in how each interacts with the glass surface.},

  abstract  = {A new, commercially available polishing process called magnetorheological finishing is used to polish and figure precision optics. To understand and model this process correctly it is important to determine the mechanical properties of the fluid under the influence of the magnetic field. Magnetorheotogical (MR) fluids are commonly modeled as Bingham fluids, so one of the essential properties to measure is the yield stress. Since MR fluids are inherently anisotropic, the yield stress will depend on the mutual orientation of the magnetic field and the direction of deformation. The relative orientation of the field and deformation in polishing does not coincide with common rheological setups, so a new rheometer has been designed and tested. This new magnetorheometer design has been shown to give correct stresses during calibration experiments using Newtonian fluids with a known viscosity. The measured stress has also been shown to have a magnitude consistent with published finite element approximations for magnetic fluids. The design of the instrument was complicated because of the requirements imposed upon the magnetic field, and the difficulty in satisfying the no slip boundary condition.

Under the influence of a magnetic field, the carbonyl iron particles (CIPs) and non-magnetic polishing abrasive particles remove material from the surface being polished. Knowledge of forces acting is important to understand the mechanism of material removal. A dynamometer and virtual instrumentation are used to on-line record the normal force and tangential force acting on the workpiece through the magnetorheological (MR) fluid. A full factorial design of experiments is used to plan the experiments and ANOVA to correlate the forces and process parameters. The selected process parameters (volume concentration of CIPs and abrasives, working gap, and wheel rotation) are varied over a range to measure forces during experimentation. The maximum contribution is made by a working gap on the forces developed on the workpiece surface followed by CIP concentration while the least contribution is noticed by the wheel speed.},

  abstract = {In modern industries with advancement of technology advanced engineering materials are needed to be used like Tungsten, Titanium alloys, ceramics, various composites etc. These materials possess some special characteristics such as high hardness, high wear resistance, high toughness, high strength etc. which make them preferred over conventional materials in modern industries. Due to the stringent properties these materials are difficult to process. Different conventional finishing processes like grinding, lapping, honing, buffing etc. are generally inefficient in finishing these materials. Although processes like abrasive flow machining, magnetic field assisted finishing processes and chemo-mechanical finishing may be used but these may be less productive. Therefore a new process which uses combination of chemical oxidation and magnetic field assisted abrasion (magnetic abrasive finishing) has been conceived in the present work for faster processing. To establish the process experiments have been conducted on tungsten work piece and the effects of various process parameters like percentage weight of abrasive, oxidizing agent concentration, rotational speed of magnet and working gap on process response namely percentage change in average surface roughness value (ΔRa) was recorded. The experiments were planned using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Experimental data was analyzed using analysis of variance to understand contribution of various process factors on process response. SEM micrographs have also been obtained to study the surface morphology of the finished work piece. Regression model was developed to predict the percentage change in surface roughness in terms of significant process factors.},

  abstract = {Magnetorheological (MR) fluids represent a class of smart materials whose rheological properties change in response to the application of a magnetic field. These fluids typically consist of small (μm) magnetizable particles dispersed in a nonmagnetic carrier fluid that generally contains additives such as surfactants and antiwear agents [1]. Due to such additives, there is an outer nonmagnetic layer on the particles that keeps them from touching. The goal of this paper is to study the effective magnetic behavior of an MR composite as a function of the interparticle distance. To this end, we present and employ a model for the effective magnetic properties of MR fluids with periodic microstructure that is based on the theory of homogenization. Finally, we discuss an interpolating formula for the effective permeability of MR fluids as an extension of the work of Keller [2] and Doyle [3].},

  abstract = {Ball end magnetorheological finishing (BEMRF) process was developed for finishing flat and 3D workpiece surfaces. A finishing tool is used to flow pressurized magnetorheological polishing fluid through the center of the rotating tool core and gets stiffened in the form of a magnetically controlled ball end shape at the tip surface of the tool. This forms a polishing spot of controlled size and shape which is used as a finishing medium by guiding it to follow the surface to be finished through computer controlled 3-axes motion. In the present study, an attempt has been made to understand the material removal and surface finishing mechanism in BEMRF process on a ferromagnetic workpiece. Based on experimental observations and force measurements, a mathematical model has been developed for modelling of magnetic field-induced normal force during finishing by BEMRF process. It is very difficult to understand the complex structure of rotating MR-polishing fluid during finishing operation, so a model of magnetic normal force is developed based on certain assumptions. Finished surfaces were also analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) to understand mechanism of material removal. In order to understand the material removal process and wear behavior during finishing, different modes of abrasive-workpiece interaction have been analyzed with respect to measured magnetic normal forces. The developed mathematical model has been used to predict magnetic normal finishing force and compared with the experimentally obtained results. Both were found in close agreement. The effect of variation in magnetic normal force was also observed experimentally in terms of percentage change in surface roughness during finishing.},

The newly developed finishing process is used to finish ferromagnetic as well as nonmagnetic materials of 3D shapes using specially prepared magnetorheological polishing (MRP) fluid. The existing MR finishing devices and methods are likely to incapable of finish 3D intricate surfaces such as grooves in workpiece or complex in-depth profiles in the mold due to restriction on relative movement of finishing medium and workpiece. In this newly developed finishing device, the ball end MR finishing tool is used for finishing different kinds of 3D surfaces, as there is no limitation on relative movement of finishing medium and workpiece. It can finish the work surfaces similarly as the machining of 3D surfaces by CNC ball end milling cutter and open a new era of its applications in future. The developed process may have its potential applications in aerospace, automotive and molds manufacturing industries. A computer controlled experimental setup is designed and manufactured to study the process characteristics and performance. The magnetostatic simulations were done on ferromagnetic as well as nonferromagnetic materials of 3D surfaces to observe the ball end shape of magnetic field at the tip of the MR finishing tool. The experiments were performed on flat EN31 and groove surface of copper workpieces in the developed MR finishing setup to study the effect of finishing time on final surface roughness.

  abstract = {This paper addresses the relationship between surface integrity and fatigue life of hard turned AISI 52100 steel (60–62 HRC), with grinding as a benchmark. The impact of superfinishing on the fatigue performance of hard turned and ground surfaces is also discussed. Specifically, the surface integrity and fatigue life of the following five distinct surface conditions are examined: hard turned with continuous white layer, hard turned with no white layer, ground, and superfinished hard turned and ground specimens. Surface integrity of the specimens is characterized via surface topography measurement, metallography, residual stress measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nano-indentation tests. High cycle tension–tension fatigue tests show that the presence of white layer does not adversely affect fatigue life and that, on average, the hard turned surface performs as well or better than the ground surface. The effect of superfinishing is to exaggerate these differences in performance. The results obtained from this study suggest that the effect of residual stress on fatigue life is more significant than the effect of white layer. For the hard turned surfaces, the fatigue life is found to be directly proportional to both the surface compressive residual stress and the maximum compressive residual stress. Possible explanations for the observed effects are discussed.},

This observation is discussed with respect to glass structure and implies that ionic exchange between hydrogen and network modifying metal cations is the major process responsible for glass hydration.},

The experimental data indicated that the effects of tool wear on machining rate highly depended on the lubricating condition of tool. The trend of machining rate versus accumulated machining time under non-contact lubricating condition was very different from that under the semi-contact one.

This study presents a detailed analysis of dynamic characteristics of adaptive beam based on MR materials. The relationship between the magnetic field and the complex shear modulus of MR materials in the pre-yield regime is researched using oscillatory rheometry techniques. A structural dynamic modelling approach is discussed and vibration characteristics of MR adaptive structures are predicted for different magnetic field levels. In addition to the model predictions, actual MR adaptive beam is fabricated and tested. Both studies illustrate the vibration minimization capabilities of the MR adaptive beam at different magnetic field levels.},

The measurement system is designed using the piezolaminated cantilever beam coupled with an electromagnetic coil based MR fluid squeezing setup. The cantilever beam is maintained at resonance using simple closed-loop electronics. The magnetic field produced by the coil changes the viscosity of MR fluids and produces an additional stiffness to the resonating cantilever beam. The shift in resonant frequency due to the change in viscosity of the MR fluid is measured, and the shift in frequency is analytically related to the yield stress. Two types of MR fluids based on sphere and plate iron particles are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measurement system.},

The 2.1-碌m mean size Fe particles were dispersed in high-concentration transformer oil-based ferrofluid, the iron particle volume fraction in the resulting nano-micro composite magnetorheological fluid samples varying from 桅 Fe = 5 to 40 %. The ferrofluid carrier has 蠁 p = 23 % solid volume fraction of magnetic nanoparticles stabilized with chemisorbed oleic acid monolayer and without any excess surfactant. In the absence of the field, the ferrofluid has a quasi-Newtonian behavior with a weak shear thinning tendency. The static yield stress shows an increase of about 3 orders of magnitude for an iron particle content of approx. 桅 Fe = 25 % (桅 tot = 42.25 %), while above this value, a saturation tendency is observed. The dynamic yield stress (Bingham model) also increases with the magnetic induction and the particle volume fraction; however, the saturation of the MR effect is less pronounced. The relative viscosity change has a maximum at 桅 Fe = (10鈥�15) % due to the accelerated increase of the effective viscosity of the composite for higher Fe content. Addition of micrometer-sized iron particles to a concentrated ferrofluid without any supplementary stabilizing agent proved to be a direct and simple way to control the magnetorheological and magnetoviscous behavior, as well as the saturation magnetization of the resulting nano-micro composite fluid to fulfill the requirements of their use in various MR control and rotating seal devices.},

  abstract = {Grinding is traditionally categorized as a finishing process in manufacturing. However, more recently it has been used as a machining process as well. Temperature distribution is crucial for investigation of thermal softening effects in the material removal process and thermal damages on the surface of workpiece. One important aspect to be considered in thermal simulations of robotic grinding is the dynamic behavior of the robot which can have significant influences on the process, especially in those performed with low stiffness robots. Most of the earlier thermal simulations of grinding processes are based on a simplified heat sourc e function representing the grinding wheel effect. In this study, heat generation due to a robotic grinding operation is distributed based on the local chip thickness and friction effect over the corresponding contact zone at the workpiece interface. The calculation of the chip thickness is based on a wear model of the grinding wheel in accordance with an impact-cutting behavior, observed with a high speed camera in our laboratory. Temperature distribution in the workpiece is simulated with a 3D transient thermal finite element (FE) code. Special attention is given to consider the dynamic effect of impact-cutting on the process which is caused by the high rotational speed of the wheel and low stiffness of the robot as a tool holder. Element deletion technique is used to represent the material removed from the workpiece and a well known model of the energy partition ratio is used and modified for the amount of energy entering into the workpiece. Grinding experiments conducted with a flexible robot showed a good agreement among simulation results and measured temperatures.},

The present study focuses on efficient fabrication of RB-SiC optical components. Here, a two-stage fabrication process is proposed. Firstly, a plate fixed with solid pellet-shaped abrasives is used for rapid removal of surface error and initial smoothing. After that, fine error removal and surface polishing is performed using felt buffs and diamond abrasives. Material removal rates and surface roughness are measured based on a Form Talysurf surface profiler. The final surface roughness with an initial value of Ra = 110.8 nanometer (nm) reached 21.6 nm after 5 min of lapping by adjusting the size of abrasives continuously from 30 to 10 micrometer (mu m), and then convergent to 10.7 nm after 15 min of polishing using different sized diamond pastes as the polishing abrasive. The validity of the two-stage process in terms of efficiency and surface quality has been verified by experiments. How these factors are affected by process parameters such as the relative rotation speed, abrasives grit size, etc. are also examined. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Uniformity of removal affects the finishing, and in some cases, the form accuracy of the polished surface. Tool paths are required for the automation of surface polishing. How the tool path may affect the removal of material in polishing is investigated in this paper. An analysis of how removal at a location due to polishing along adjacent path lines is presented. Four tool paths reportedly used in polishing are covered: scanning, bi-scanning, Hilbert and Peano paths. Removal in the inner surface as well as near the edges of surfaces is examined through simulations and analysis. The results show that, for the same path pitch, the peak-to-valley height (hpv) in the inner part of the removal map is the same for scanning, bi-scanning and Peano, while the texture of the removal maps can be quite different. The hpv values of Hilbert are more than double those of Peano, although both are fractal paths. Removal near the edges is particularly severe for scanning-type tool paths. The ratio of the edge peak height to the inner peak height is about 1.6 on average for scanning. The uniformity of removal further deteriorates as the ellipticity of the tool contact increases. When the contact direction is closely aligned with the path line direction, that ratio goes up to about 2.9 for contact ellipticity of 2. Polishing experiments have also been conducted. Both experiments and simulations point to the presence of edge effects in scanning paths and its absence in Peano paths. It is further proposed that, for more uniform removal of material: (1) changes in the tool path direction should be well distributed and (2) the direction of the path lines should be well balanced over the entire surface.},

The force acts as the polishing pressure by relative motion between a work and the compound, which is given by fixing the work to the spindle and the vessel to the table of a vertical milling machine in this investigation. The increase of viscosity of the compound which is obtained by higher volumetric contents of the abrasives improves the efficiency of this finishing process.},

  abstract = {A theoretical model of the residual stress of ceramics grinding has been established applying thermal elastoplastic mechanics theory. While grinding, as the path of the grinding wheel moves along the workpiece surface, the distributing regulation of the residual stress can be simplified to a thermal elastoplastic mechanical issue, under the action of both the moving centralized force and the heat source. Calculation and evaluation of the surface residual stress using the current revised procedure of finite element analysis is successful. Compared with an X-ray diffraction experiment method, satisfactory precision is displayed.},

Pure process modelling in order to understand the grinding mechanisms and to predict the work result is difficult. In view of this, several approaches by academia and by industry were made to address this issue. One such approach is the development and implementation of process monitoring in grinding. The work presented in this paper summarises the various elements and approaches in process monitoring during grinding. The paper deals with the relevant quantities that describe the grinding process itself and the ensuing work result. Furthermore the different sensing techniques are introduced to measure the relevant quantities. Finally an overview is presented as to the strategies and techniques involved in the interpretation of the measured data and the subsequent control action initiated in order to close the process control loop.},

In the fluid mechanics setting, these are typically the Stokeslet (the kernel of the single layer potential) or the Stresslet (the kernel of the double layer potential). In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for the rapid evaluation of such fields, using a decomposition into a small number of Coulombic N-body problems, following an approach similar to that of Fu and Rodin [Y. Fu, G.J. Rodin, Fast solution methods for three-dimensional Stokesian many-particle problems, Commun. Numer. Meth. En. 16 (2000) 145鈥�149]. While any fast summation algorithm for Coulombic interactions can be employed, we present numerical results from a scheme based on the most modern version of the fast multipole method [H. Cheng, L. Greengard, V. Rokhlin, A fast adaptive multipole algorithm in three dimensions, J. Comput. Phys. 155 (1999) 468鈥�498].

One way to polish these optics is by using a jet of abrasive/fluid mixture. Widely used abrasive water jet machining is not applicable for precision polishing because of natural jet instability, which gives an unstable removal function. Theoretical and experimental results in this paper show how this problem can be addressed with a magnetically stabilized jet of magnetorheological fluid. Polishing results demonstrate the suitability for this technique for precision finishing of complex shapes.},

Magnetic fluids can be used as lubricants in gears, plain bearings and roller bearings. With an appropriate designed magnetic field the lubricants can be fixed at those places, where they are needed. The main advantage of the use of magnetic fluids as lubricant is based on the considerable reduction of the maintenance for the lubricant supply, because the lubricant is prevented from leaving the contact zone of the tribological system. Further advantages are the small amount of the necessary lubricant and the avoidance of leakages. The theological and tribological behaviour of magnetic fluids was investigated and compared with conventional lubricants between friction pairs under boundary conditions.

The results indicated that: the iron subjected to durability testing had oxidized; a portion of the iron oxides were crystalline magnetite; and the oxides were concentrated at the perimeter of the smaller iron particles although both large and small particles were oxidized. This oxidation may explain the gradual loss of fan clutch torque capacity observed during the 540 h durability test.},

  abstract = {A new apparatus was designed and built for the finishing of large size/large batch silicon nitride (Si3N4) balls by magnetic float polishing (MFP) technology for hybrid bearing applications. The polishing chamber is so designed that during polishing it can self-align with the upper part of the polishing chamber connected to the spindle. In situ machining of the upper part of the chamber is performed on the machine tool in which the apparatus is located, in order to achieve high accuracy and geometric alignment of the system. The finishing methodology consists of mechanical polishing followed by chemo-mechanical polishing. Boron carbide (B4C), silicon carbide (SiC), and cerium oxide (CeO2) are the three abrasives used in this investigation. Three stages are involved in polishing, namely, 1. a roughing stage to remove maximum material without imparting any damage to the surface, 2. an intermediate stage of semi-finishing to control the size and improve sphericity, and 3. a final finishing stage to obtain best surface finish and sphericity while maintaining the final diameter. Taguchi method was applied for the roughing stage to optimize the polishing conditions for the best material removal rate. Level average response analysis has indicated that a load of 1.5 N/ball, an abrasive concentration of 20%, and a speed of 400 rpm would give a high material removal rate using B4C (500 grit) abrasive. A groove is formed on the bevel of the upper part of the chamber which plays different roles, some beneficial and other not so beneficial, in each stage. In the roughing stage, it is preferable, though not essential, to machine the groove after each run to maintain high material removal rates. It is, however, necessary to remove the groove formed at the end of the roughing stage. In the intermediate or semifinishing stage, sphericity can be significantly improved by not machining the groove. Thus groove, in this case, facilitates in the improvement of sphericity. Before the beginning of the final finishing stage, machining the groove is necessary for rapid improvement in the surface finish. A batch of 46, 3/4 in. Si3N4 balls was finished to a final diameter of 0.7500 in. with an average sphericity of similar to 0.25 mu m (best ;value of 0. 15 mu m) and an average surface finish, Ra of similar to 8 nm (best value of 6.7 nm) with an actual polishing time of < 30 h. This technology is easy to implement in industry and does not entile high capital investment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is important to understand the magnetic response of MRF and its dependence on several parameters for improving and designing MRF devices. The purpose of this work is to develop a constitutive model that describes the behavior of the shear yield stress of the material as function of the magnetic field and composition. Taking into account that the material changes its rheology and apparent viscosity according to magnetic field, a magnetically induced state transition is proposed; by the use of a state transition equation, a constitutive model for shear yield stress is defined, consisting of an expression that relates composition of the material and the stimulus applied, it also associates the volume fraction of particles, magnetic field and the material that composes the particles.},

Their magnetorheological (MR) behavior has been studied in steady-state flow regime and under dynamic torsion oscillations on a commercial rheometer. At zero magnetic field, in spite of a rather high molecular mass, the hyperbranched polymers as well as their magnetic compositions with up to 72 mass% of magnetic filler demonstrate Newtonian behavior, and their viscosity considerably increases with magnetic filler content. In magnetic fields MFs show a huge MR response. Namely, in steady-state flow experiments a five orders of magnitude increase in viscosity was observed accompanied by magnetic-field-induced well-pronounced non-Newtonian behavior and a non-zero yield stress. Dynamic experiments demonstrate the transition from liquid-like to solid-like behavior of MFs with a large increase in both the storage and loss moduli under application of a magnetic field. In magnetic fields, the rheological behavior of the obtained MF resembles that of soft MR elastomers being mainly determined by the magnetic particle network formed due to magnetic interactions. In particular, like MR elastomers the MFs exhibit the Payne effect, i.e. dependence of the dynamic modulus on the strain amplitude.},

  abstract = {Magnetic permeability data of cobalt ferrite and carbonyl iron suspensions are discussed. Using an induction method, the relative differential permeability, μr,dif, was measured as a function of the internal magnetic field for different volume fractions of the solid phase. In the case of cobalt ferrite suspensions, the μr,dif−H curve was obtained for a first increasing ramp of magnetic field (data series “1”), a decreasing ramp (data series “2”), and the second increasing one (data series “3”). Series “1” showed a maximum in the μr,dif−H trend that did not appear in series “2” and “3”. Furthermore, the data in series “2” and “3” are always below those in series “1”. The latter behavior could be ascribed to the presence of hysteresis, and in fact it was not observed in carbonyl iron suspensions, where hysteresis is absent. The presence of the maximum in permeability is common for both types of suspensions. It is found that it only disappears if the particle motions are restricted by dispersing them in a rigid (epoxy) matrix, or if the suspensions are previously structured by applying a magnetic field to a sample prepared in an elastomer matrix. We conclude that the maxima in μr,dif−H curves are associated to the motion or orientation of the dispersed particles during application of the first field ramp. The comparison with predictions of models allows to deduce some quantitative information on the structures formed by the particles.},

By contrast, the magnetic field integral equation is well-conditioned (in simply connected domains) and can be used in the low frequency limit without modification or preconditioning. Reconstruction of the electric field, however, is subject to catastrophic cancellation unless appropriate measure are taken. In this paper, we show that solving an auxiliary (scalar) integral equation for the charge overcomes this form of low frequency breakdown, both in the near and far fields. Moreover, both the current and charge can be discretized using simple piecewise polynomial basis functions on triangulated surfaces. We also analyze an alternative formulation involving magnetic current and charge and illustrate the performance of the methods with several numerical examples.},

It is found that the addition of increasing concentrations of small particles increases the saturation magnetization, the coercive field, and the low-field susceptibility. The results are explained considering that the nano-magnetite used has a moderately wide size distribution, that embraces both the range of superparamagnetism (the lowest size interval) and of finite coercivity, all being single domain. In addition, the formation of a cloud of small particles surrounding the larger ones favors the chain formation by dipolar magnetic aggregation. It is concluded that the admixture of even small amounts of nanoparticles offers an excellent tool for the control of the magnetic properties of magnetite suspensions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe an investigation of the stability and sedimentation behavior of moderately concentrated suspensions of extremely bimodal magnetite particles, including micro- (diameter 1450 nm) and nano- (diameter 8 nm) units. An original method is used, based on the determination of the time dependence of the inductance of a coil surrounding the suspensions. The method proves to be very useful for the determination of the volume fraction of magnetic material in the sensed volume. The observed changes in the resonant frequency of a parallel LC circuit demonstrate that the addition of the magnetite nanoparticles improves the stability and slows down the settling rate of the mixed suspensions. It is proposed that the observed behavior is the result of competition between two processes. One is the formation of a cloud of nanoparticles around the large magnetite units, by virtue of which the latter are maintained at distances beyond the range of DLVO and magnetic attractive interactions. At long times, these composite units will eventually sediment when some critical size is reached, as the small particles are progressively associated with the large ones. The second mechanism is mainly predominant at short times and is related to the higher viscosity of the dispersion medium (the nanoparticles dispersed in the base fluid) for higher nanoparticle concentrations. The stability of the suspensions is discussed in terms of the competition between the two mechanisms.},

The electrical double-layer characteristics of the solid/liquid interface were studied in the absence and presence of adsorbed layers of high molecular weight polyacrylic acids (PAA; Carbopol). Since the Carbopol-covered particles can be thought of as “soft” colloids, Ohshima's theory was used to gain information of the surface potential and the charge density of the polymer layer. The effect of the pH of the solution on the double-layer characteristics is related to the different conformations of the adsorbed molecules provoked by the dissociation of the acrylic groups present in polymer molecules. The stability of the suspensions was experimentally studied for different pH and polymer concentrations, and in the absence or presence of a weak magnetic field applied. The stability of the suspensions was explained using the classical DLVO theory of colloidal stability extended to account for hydration, steric, and magnetic interactions between particles. Diagrams of potential energy vs interparticle distance show the predominant effect of steric, hydrophilic/hydrophobic, and magnetic interactions on the whole stability of the system. The best conditions to obtain stable suspensions were found when strong steric and hydrophilic repulsions hinder the coagulation between polymer-covered particles, simultaneously avoiding sedimentation by the thickening effect of the polymer solution. When a not too high molecular weight PAA was employed in a low concentration, the task of a long-time antisettling effect compatible with the desired magnetic response of the fluid was achieved.},

We present experimental results which show that, when the shear forces are much lower than the dipolar magnetic forces, then the usual structure made of cylindrical aggregates rearrange in a well-defined striped pattern whose period can be predicted by introducing an hydrodynamic pressure. If instead of an alternating shear flow we use a steady shear flow, then we observe a jump of stress at some critical shear rate which is related to the onset of a new layered pattern. We demonstrate that, if instead of a steady shear flow in a constant field, we use a rotating field we observe the same kind of layered pattern. The origin of these layered patterns is shown to be due to the average attractive dipolar interaction in the plane of rotation of the field.},

  Abstract                 = {A Monte Carlo (MC) model has been developed to investigate the influences of the volume packing fraction and applied field on the equilibrium microstructure of a dispersion of barium ferrite particles. We accounted for magnetostatic interaction effects by using a surface charge model which allows the calculation of the energy term required for the Metropolis-type MC algorithm. In addition to single particle moves, the model employs a clustering algorithm, based on particle proximity, in order to take into account the cooperative behaviour of the particles bound by magnetostatic energy. The stacks which are thought to be characteristic of barium ferrite systems are an example of this type of binding. Our study provides strong evidence, in agreement with experiment, for the formation of stacks both in the zero field and in the applied field equilibrium configurations. The simulation also predicts, by considering the effects of the packing density, that the dispersion properties are strongly affected by the mobility of these stacks. The equilibrium particle configurations have been investigated using a correlation function and visualized by computer graphics. The magnetic behaviour has been investigated by calculation of the magnetization curve.},

  abstract = {With the development of industry manufacturing technology, fine surface finish is in high demand in a wide spectrum of industrial applications. Presently, it is required that the parts used in manufacturing semiconductors, atomic energy parts, medical instruments and aerospace components have a very precise surface roughness. Amongst them, vacuum tubes, wave guides and sanitary tubes are difficult to polish by conventional finishing methods such as lapping, because of their shapes. The surface roughness of these tubes affects the performance of the entire system, but the finishing technology for these tubes is very scant in manufacturing fields. This project was proposed by a Shanghai Far East pharmaceutial and mechanical factory. They stated that the roughness of the inner surface must be less than 0.3 μm Ra after finishing. An internal magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) process is proposed for producing highly finished inner surfaces of tubes used in this study. The process principle and the finishing characteristics of unbounded magnetic abrasive within internal tubing finishing are described first. MAF setup was designed for finishing three kinds of materials tubing, such as Ly12 aluminum alloy, 316L stainless steel and H62 brass. Experimental results indicated that finishing parameters such as polishing speed, magnetic abrasive supply, abrasive material, magnetic abrasive manufacturing process and grain size have critical effects on the material removal rate (MRR). How the inner surface micro shape changes course during finishing of an aluminous tube is demonstrated.},

MAFF provides a high level of surface finish and close tolerances for wide range of industrial application.

  abstract = {An accurate characterization of subsurface properties is essential to understand machining induced surface integrity. However, little research has been conducted to investigate significant influences of surface integrity (hardness and residual stress) and tip geometry on the indentation process and the resulting load–depth curves. Nanoindentation was used to measure hardness and modulus in the subsurface of machined components by turning, grinding, and honing. The machining induced residual stresses can be estimated by matching the FEA simulated load–depth curves with the experimental ones. The simulation sensitivity analysis shows that the load–depth curves are significantly affected by residual stress and modulus, while friction, tip rounding, and yield strength have much smaller effects. The peak normal stresses occur on the top surface, while the peak shear stress is slightly under the surface. All peak strains are in the subsurface. The onset of material yielding during loading may be determined by tracing the evolution of loading/unloading loops at different indentation depths. A 3D simulation of nanoindentation with a spherical tip has shown that the indentation force induced by the spherical tip is less than 2% of the total force provided that the indentation depth is sufficiently large.},

  abstract = {Surface integrity of machined components is critical for product performance in service. Due to the very small scale of the subsurface, nanoindentation can be used to determine the surface/subsurface mechanical properties. However, the test data may be significantly influenced by machining induced residual stresses, strain hardening, size effect, and microstructures. A fundamental relationship between these factors and mechanical behavior in the subsurface is yet to be understood. Furthermore, it is not clear if residual stress in the subsurface can be determined from nanoindentation data. This study focuses on the basic relationships between nanohardness, residual stress, and microstructure. A series of nanoindentation tests were conducted on the cross-sections of the machined samples with distinct surface integrity induced by hard turning, grinding, and honing. It was found that white layer increases nanohardness and dark layer decreases nanohardness in subsurface, while strain hardening only slightly increases subsurface hardness. The research results indicate that residual stress nature can be qualitatively determined by the shape of a load–displacement curve and the characteristic parameters such as slope at initial loading, total depth, residual depth, and the ratio of residual depth to total depth. Residual stress affects the load–displacement curve shape at the onset of material yielding. Microstructure changes make a significant difference on the characteristics of a load–displacement curve, while strain hardening exerts slight influence. The effect of residual stress influence on indentation depth can be explained based on the Mohr's circle.},

The severe distortions raise significant numerical problems in performing a simulation and analyzing surface integrity. In this study, adaptive meshing techniques of initial angle control (IAC) and mesh constraint control (MCC) were exploited to improve mesh quality of the machined surface. Simulations with and without adaptive meshing and different adaptive techniques were conducted and compared to evaluate their effectiveness on surface mesh quality. The simulation results have shown that the use of adaptive mesh in metal cutting simulations improves the stability of saw-tooth chip formation. Adaptive mesh can significantly mitigate element distortions, stresses, strains, and temperatures in the subsurface and therefore improve mesh quality. IAC and MCC adaptive meshing at high frequency give similar results which are consistent with experimental observations, while a low adaptive frequency tends to give deviated results. The importance of using adaptive mesh has been demonstrated if surface integrity is considered.},

  Abstract                 = {The equations of motion describing the response of a ferromagnetic system in the micromagnetic approximation are developed by applying Hamilton's principle to an action functional constructed from a Lagrangian density composed of the usual free energy expression, together with a suitably chosen expression for the kinetic energy density so as to produce the characteristic Larmor precession associated with magnetic spin systems under the influence of an external field. A suitable choice of the form of the generalised momenta and the standard form of the Rayleigh dissipation energy density functional, leads to equations of motion which exhibit similar behaviour to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert form. It is shown that with our Hamiltonian formulation, micromagnetic simulations of systems with very many degrees of freedom can be performed with a substantial increase in the upper limit on the timestep size.},

Magnetic cluster themselves may produce the up and down movement change under alternating magnetic force. The movement may not only promote the dispersion of micro-magnetic particles, but also improve stirring effect and cross-cutting effects of the abrasives, achieving circulation and update to ensure the stability of grinding tools. This process is considered to be able to efficiently apply in ultra-precision finishing of plane and complicated micro-surfaces. In this study, we investigated the effects of alternating magnetic field on magnetic field distribution, finishing force and abrasive behavior. Furthermore, a set of experimental devices have been designed for finishing SUS304 stainless steel plate. The present work is aimed at understanding finishing particularity of this process and studying impacts of important process parameters namely grinding fluid, rotational speed of magnetic pole, current frequency on change in finish surface and material removal. Experimental results indicate that the process can realize ultra-precision finishing of plane by using oily grinding fluid. In the present research, the surface roughness of SUS304 stainless steel plate was improved from 240.24 nm to 4.38 nm by this process.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive theoretical study has been carried out on the flow behavior of both single and multiple phase non-Newtonian fluids in porous media. This work is divided into three parts: 1) development of numerical and analytical solutions； 2) theoretical studies of transient flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media； and 3) applications of well test analysis and displacement efficiency evaluation to field problems. A fully implicit, integral finite difference model has been developed for simulation of non-Newtonian and Newtonian fluid flow through porous media. Several commonly-used rheological models of power-law and Bingham plastic non-Newtonian fluids have been incorporated in the simulator. A Buckley-Leverett type analytical solution for one-dimensional, immiscible displacement involving non-Newtonian fluids in porous media has been developed. Based on this solution, a graphic approach for evaluating non-Newtonian displacement efficiency has been developed. The Buckley-Leverett-Welge theory is extended to flow problems with non-Newtonian fluids. An integral method is also presented for the study of transient flow of Bingham fluids in porous media. In addition, two well test analysis methods have been developed for analyzing pressure transient tests of power-law and Bingham fluids, respectively. Applications are included to demonstrate this new technology. The physical mechanisms involved in immiscible displacement with non-Newtonian fluids in porous media have been studied using the Buckley-Leverett type analytical solution. The results show that this kind of displacement is a complicated process and is determined by the rheological properties of the non-Newtonian fluids and the flow conditions, in addition to relative permeability data. In another study, an idealized fracture model has been used to obtain some insights into the flow of a power-law fluid in a double-porosity medium. For flow at a constant rate, non-Newtonian flow behavior in a fractured medium is characterized by two-parallel straight lines on a log-log plot of injection pressure versus time. Transient flow of a general pseudoplastic fluid has been studied numerically and it has been found that the long time pressure responses tend to be equivalent to that of a Newtonian system.

  abstract = {So far there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism of material removal in chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). Some researchers model the CMP process based on the mechanism proposed by Kaufman et al. [1], who attribute the material removal from the wafer surface to chemistry-aided mechanical abrasions. Other researchers develop models for the CMP process based on a chemical tooth mechanism conjectured by Cook [2], who emphasizes the role of chemical reactions on the wafer surface. However, there is much evidence that both mechanisms are flawed. To clarify these issues, and reconcile the apparently contradictory conjectures [1,2], and provide a framework for further detailed modeling, a unified mechanism of material removal is proposed: the material at the wafer surface is removed by the strong shear stress from the non-Newtonian slurry flow in-between the wafer surface and the pad. Based on the proposed mechanism, a brief mathematical formulation is introduced to qualitatively describe the material removal rate. The proposed mechanism can be readily applied to explain the edge or the doming effect associated with non-uniform material removal for polishing blanket or patterned wafers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This process can be time consuming and labor intensive. Recently, there are several computer controlled polishing systems being introduced to the industry for improving the polishing process such as magnetorhelogical finishing and precession polishing. However, these processes either have limitations on material selection or on cycle times. Polishing pressure is one of the most important parameters to control during a polishing process. There are designs with different mechanisms to maintain a constant polishing pressure from pressure-sensitive polishing arm to weight balance method. In this research program an innovative method was introduced to monitor and control the polishing pressure. A precision in line torque sensor is used to couple the polishing head and the motor. The primary feedback on the polishing axis is tool position. Once the polishing tool makes contact with the mold surface then the torque signal will be utilized as the primary feedback signal for minor adjustment on the polishing tool vertical position for maintaining constant pressure. A process using the pin polisher with different size diamond pastes was also developed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cobalt chrome alloys are the most extensively used material in the field of total hip and total knee implants, both of which need highly accurate form and low surface roughness for longevity in vivo. In order to achieve the desired form, it is extremely important to understand how process parameters of the final finishing process affect the material removal rate. This paper reports a modified Preston equation model combining process parameters to allow prediction of the material removal rate during bonnet polishing of a medical grade cobalt chrome alloy. The model created is based on experiments which were carried out on a bonnet polishing machine to investigate the effects of process parameters, including precess angle, head speed, tool offset and tool pressure, on material removal rate. The characteristic of material removal is termed influence function and assessed in terms of width, maximal depth and material removal rate. Experimental results show that the width of the influence function increases significantly with the increase of the precess angle and the tool offset; the depth of the influence function increases with the increase of the head speed, increases first and then decrease with the increase of the tool offset; the material removal rate increases with the increase of the precess angle non-linearly, with the increase of the head speed linearly, and increases first then decreases with the increase of the tool offset because of the bonnet distortion; the tool pressure has a slight effect on the influence function. The proposed model has been verified experimentally by using different Preston coefficients from literature. The close values of the experimental data and predicted data indicate that the model is viable when applied to the prediction of the material removal rate in bonnet polishing.},

The results showed that the amplitudes of the fundamental and second harmonics of the nonlinear Rayleigh waves decreased with increasing average width of surface scratches due to the interaction between scratch-induced cracks and wave propagation. The increase of the nonlinearity with the average scratch width suggests that the surface scratches caused the decrease of apparent Young's modulus near the glass surface. Nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves could be a potential method for the quantitative and rapid measurement of surface and subsurface damage in brittle materials.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Mechanical components shaped by hard turning processes are commonly used under high stress and repeated loading conditions. The physical strength and fatigue life of these components is known to be significantly affected by the residual stress distributions induced by finish hard turning. A thorough understanding of the residual stress profile including both magnitude and direction along the depth of the hard turned workpiece is therefore very important to maximize component life and improve its performance. Many studies have been conducted to determine the effect of cutting tool geometry, cutting parameters, and workpiece material on residual stress distribution in hard turning. However, due to the complexity of hard turning processes, the effect factors considered in these studies are typically insufficient. Knowledge of the most important effect factors such as cooling type, insert grade and tool geometry, tool wear, cutting conditions, and workpiece material has been limited. Very few analytical models are available and accurate enough to predict residual stress profiles in hard turning. In this paper, a series of experiments were designed based on the factorial robust engineering method to explore the full factors affecting the residual stress profiles, and an intelligent model based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was developed to predict circumferential and longitudinal residual stress profiles in hard turning. The prediction results match the experimental results well, and much higher performance relative to conventional linear regression method has been achieved.},

The slurry suitable for polishing PC and PMMA was then chosen, and further CMP experiments were carried out under different process conditions. Experimental results showed that increasing table speed or head load increased the material removal rates of the polymers. The polymeric surface quality after CMP was acceptable to most MEMS applications. Analysis of variance was also carried out, and it was found that the interaction of head load and table speed had a significant (95\% confidence) effect on surface finish of polished PMMA.

Under simulated conditions, a sub-ambient fluid pressure was observed, and its magnitude was of the same order of magnitude as the applied polishing load. Since this fluid pressure is non-uniformly distributed, the contact stress, obtained by combining the effects of both applied load and the fluid pressure, is not uniform across the wafer and will result in non-uniform material removal.

The magnetized walls are modeled by a congregation of magnetic dipoles and their effects on the MPs are considered. The simple shear flow of the base fluid with linear velocity distribution is used to generate the shear deformation of the MP structure and the yield stresses under different shear rates are obtained. Comparing with the relatively long chains forming in base fluid without the effect of magnetized walls, the initial structure of MPs is mainly in the form of short chains due to the attractive force of walls. At the beginning of the shear deformation of the MP structure, the concentration of MPs near the walls is found. As the shear deformation develops, however, the chains concentrate at the center of the simulation domain and the MPs near wall boundaries are attracted to the center. The yield stress depends on the initial structure of MPs which is affected by the magnetized walls. It is revealed that the larger shear rate of base fluid results in the larger yield stress, and the effects of the magnetization intensity of the walls and their space distance on the yield stress are also investigated.},

In this study, lapping experiments are conducted on silicon by mixing two SiC abrasive grits, with different mean sizes and at various ratios, under two normal loadings. Lapped surfaces are examined by optical microscopy, where the number and size of critical surface feature types are characterized quantitatively with image processing. The results are correlated with the material removal rate (MRR) by modeling a lapping quality index (LQI) to evaluate different mixed abrasive ratios, where it is shown that lapping performance can be improved by mixing abrasives at high loadings.},

A smooth (Ra = 1 nm), defect-free SiC surface is achieved when a SIC sample is polished in a 3 wt.% CrO3 solution at speeds of 4-6 cm/s and loads of 1.96 N-9.8 N.

  abstract  = {The structures of nonaqueous suspensions subjected to electrical fields and continuous shear are described. Based on observations that particle strands and columns formed upon application of an electric field behave as elastic solids for small shear strains but yield above a critical strain, models for the yield stress and continuous-shear response of these electrorheological (ER) suspensions are developed. Comparison of model calculations with experimental results indicates that the yield stress is dominated by the work required to overcome electrically induced interparticle forces. The continuous-shear response of these suspensions can be understood in terms of the gradual degradation of solid-like masses of particles as the shear rate is raised. A continuum model incorporating these concepts is developed, and a comparison with continuous shear data shows an excellent model of ER suspension flow can be developed by considering suspension response as a sum of the behaviors in the zero shear rate and in the high shear rate, zero field strength regions.},

  abstract  = {The concentration dependence of the sedimentation rate has been studied for a variety of colloids with a magnetic core and nonmagnetic shell. The nonmagnetic shell was either a silica layer or, in the case of magnetic fluids, a surfactant layer. It was found that the (linear) concentration dependence is very much affected by the thickness of the nonmagnetic shell and varied from negative for repulsive particles to positive for a sufficiently strong net attraction. This change in sign is in accordance with a recent theory for sedimentation of dipolar hard spheres. The sensitivity of concentration-dependent sedimentation to interaction details is also illustrated by the significant influence of any van der Waals attraction and surface charge, which competes with the effect of magnetic attraction. Our study shows that surface charge may be important in nonaqueous magnetic fluids.},

The structural and magnetorheological properties of the sample (MRF-LM5) were compared with the same characteristics measured for a commercial MR fluid (MRF-132DG, LORD Co., USA) of similar saturation magnetization. The sedimentation rate of particles measured by X-ray transmission in MRF-LM5 is twice slower than in MRF-132DG, while the MR effect is higher for the commercial MR sample.},
